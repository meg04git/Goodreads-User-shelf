0,34207200,100 Haiku,,Prakash Hegade,2017,Prakash Hegade,,"Though there are several forms of poetry, Haiku is one form which I like the most. It is for a reason that very easily the efforts put in to write a haiku might go plain and senseless. Like, they might just become a set of words which do not speak out the message which they were intended to. Though they are in the structure of three lines, they can speak a book of stories. It takes time to pen down a haiku and it’s that effort that gives the pleasure.",3,9,,,ebook,False,"Last Another Day (Dangerous Days #1);What Young India Wants;Half Girlfriend;One Indian Girl;A Few Haiku;For a Few Haiku More;One Way or Another: A Friends to Lovers Contemporary Romance (The Sisters Quartet Book 1);Ripcord Recovery;Haiku  Selected Poems Volume III;Loneliness and Sorrow Poetry & Haiku;Haiku Snake (With Head): Haiku Poems;The Initiatory Process in Ancient Egypt (Rosicrucian Order AMORC Kindle Editions);The Old Man and the Sea;A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, #3)",,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1486627711l/34207200._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1486627711l/34207200._SX98_.jpg

0,34598841,Poem Shop,,Prakash Hegade,2017,Prakash Hegade,,"For me, poems are happiness. This book is the fourth one in series of the poems I have pen down. The first one was ‘P for Poetry’ which gave me the ‘go good’ feeling. Second one ‘Poetic Desk’ gave me the ability to see and pen down poems with dept. Then came ‘100 Haiku’ where I enjoyed writing haiku and the stories they tell in three lines.<br /><br /><br />This one, ‘Poem Shop’ has most of my favorites. There are around ten limericks too which make up to a total of 25 poems. There is no specific genre of titles. It surrounds the emotions and thoughts of day to day life. I hope reading these poems will bring you joy.",0,3,,,ebook,False,None,poetry,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1489568524l/34598841._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1489568524l/34598841._SX98_.jpg

A chimera.<br />After years of abuse and rejection, 19-year-old Evelyn Kingston is ready for a fresh start in a new city, where no one knows her name. The esteemed Billington University in sunny Southern California seems like the perfect place to reinvent herself—to live the life of an ordinary human.<br /><br />But things at Billington aren’t as they seem. In a school filled with prodigies, socialites, and the leaders of tomorrow, Eve finds that the complex social hierarchy makes passing as a human much harder than she had anticipated. Even worse, Billington is harboring a secret of its own: Interlopers have infiltrated the university, and their sinister plans are targeted at chimeras—like Eve. <br /><br />Instantly, Eve’s new life takes a drastic turn. In a time filled with chaos, is the world focusing on the wrong enemy? And when the situation at Billington shifts from hostile to dangerous, will Eve remain in the shadows, or rise up and fight?",357,1364,2015,547,Paperback,True,"The Alpha Drive (The Alpha Drive, #1);Keeper (Keeper Duology #1);The Elysian Prophecy;Seeker (Keeper Duology #2);The Order of Omega (The Alpha Drive, #2);Restitution (The Alpha Drive, #3);Song of the Dryad;Little Birds;The Stolen Kingdom: An Aladdin Retelling;The Distance from A to Z;The Upside of Falling;The Flywheel;The Bar Code Rebellion (Bar Code, #2);The Gospel According to Drew Barrymore;Plus One is a Lucky Number;A Weekend with Mr. Darcy (Austen Addicts, #1);Her Secret Husband (Secrets of Eden, #4);Maid for Me, Too",sci-fi fantasy young-adult favorites science-fiction books-i-own dnf fiction owned romance,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1431381052l/25523025._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1431381052l/25523025._SX98_.jpg
