His stunning first novel, The Notebook, has been given by friend to friend and lover to lover all over the world as a testament to the timeless power of love. But if we thought he could never again move us so deeply, he now shows us he can-in a story that renews our faith in destiny...in the ability of true lovers to find each other no matter where, no matter when... Message In A Bottle <br /><br />Thrown to the waves, and to fate, the bottle could have ended up anywhere. Instead, it is found just three weeks after it begins its journey. Theresa Osborne, divorced and the mother of a twelve-year-old son, picks it up during a seaside vacation from her job as a Boston newspaper columnist. Inside is a letter that opens with: <br /><br />My Dearest Catherine, I miss you my darling, as I always do, but today is particularly hard because the ocean has been singing to me, and the song is that of our life together... <br /><br />For ""Garrett,"" the man who signs the letter, the message is the only way he knows to express his undying love for a woman he has lost. For Theresa, wary of romance since her husband shattered her trust, the message raises questions that intrigue her. Who are Garrett and Catherine? Where is he now? What is his story? <br /><br />Challenged by the mystery, and pulled to find Garrett by emotions she does not fully understand, Theresa begins a search that takes her to a sunlit coastal town and an unexpected confrontation. Brought together by chance-or something more powerful-Theresa and Garrett are people whose lives are about to touch for a purpose, in a tale that resonates with our deepest hopes for finding that special someone and everlasting love. <br /><br />Shimmering with suspense and emotional intensity, Message in a Bottle takes readers on a hunt for the truth about a man and his memories, and about both the heartbreaking fragility and enormous strength of love. For those who cherished The Notebook and readers waiting to discover the magic of Nicholas Sparks's storytelling, here is his new, achingly lovely novel of happenstance, desire, and the choices that matter most...",4171,209880,1988.0,342.0,Paperback,False,"Dear John (screenplay);The Lucky One (Main Theme): Piano Solo, Sheet;The Last Song: Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack;Safe Harbour;Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas;P.S.

Everywhere your eyes turn, you will feast on the lovely birds singing their heart out in the lush green vegetation. Osiris Mysterio ruled the regions of Empyrea with his brother Tyrant Seth and with their children Pitheceus Babi, Kraity Wadjet, and Horus Mysterio. <br /> <br />5000 years ago, the ancient Egyptians were the only humans to receive the invitation to enter Empyrea. They gladly on-boarded into a Pegasus chariot and took their journey to Empyrea. Their journey is indescribable. Empyrea by itself was like a fairy-tale garden, an ocean of flowers and exotic trees. <br /> <br />As the Egyptians went further inside Empyrea, they saw its netherworld. They had mixed feelings when they saw the triangle shaped tombs and the bizarre headhunting people. Empyrea also had the blood-curdling creatures like the deadly dinosaurs, gigantic snakes, furious apes, ruthless rhino’s, massive mastodons and many other creepy creatures. This showed the power of the Empyrean Army and that no other army could survive their wrath. <br /> <br />The Emperor Osiris and the kings ruled Empyrea with powerful Scepters. With those powers, they were not only considered as kings but also worshipped as Lords. The Lords with the help of their scepter had the crucial power to transform themselves into giant creatures. <br /> <br />Egyptians while departing from Empyrea was gifted with a shortcut portal to earth and also with some people and creatures of Empyrea to build the Empramids in Egypt. Overwhelmed with happiness they took the shortcut door and returned to Egypt. <br /> <br />However, the happiness was short-lived in Empyrea. The Empire of Empyrea was betrayed for ruling earth avariciously. Somehow the Emperor of Empyrea locked the shortcut portal and asked the Egyptians to safeguard it. The Egyptians, on the other hand, failed to safeguard the portal. And some gangsters accidentally opened the shortcut door in 2017 A.D, entered Empyrea, and inadvertently got access to the Lord scepters. <br /> <br />So, now the Earthians were left with no choice but to battle against the merciless predators and headhunting people in their heroic journey. Their ultimate fate lied in an empire beyond imagination. They would take their stand against the powerful lords, who brutally led their people to war against planet Earth. <br /> <br />Did the gangsters protect the earth from danger, or left the other world to accomplish their tyrant rule on Earth? Explore the world of Empyrea to unravel the truth behind this mystery. <br /> <br />About the Author: <br />Vignesh Ravichandran holds a Masters in Business Administration from a leading Business School.

Blanchard,2000.0,MissingPublisher,en-US,"What do your people at work and your spouse and kids at home have in common with a five-ton killer whale? Probably a whole lot more than you think, according to top business consultant and mega-bestselling author Ken Blanchard and his coauthors from SeaWorld. In this moving and inspirational new book, Blanchard explains that both whales and people perform better when you accentuate the positive. He shows how using the techniques of animal trainers -- specifically those responsible for the killer whales of SeaWorld -- can supercharge your effectiveness at work and at home. <p> When gruff business manager and family man Wes Kingsley visited SeaWorld, he marveled at the ability of the trainers to get these huge killer whales, among the most feared predators in the ocean, to perform amazing acrobatic leaps and dives. Later, talking to the chief trainer, he learned their techniques of building trust, accentuating the positive, and redirecting negative behavior -- all of which make these extraordinary performances possible. Kingsley took a hard look at his own often accusatory management style and recognized how some of his shortcomings as a manager, spouse, and father actually diminish trust and damage relationships. He began to see the difference between ""GOTcha"" (catching people doing things wrong) and ""Whale Done!"" (catching people doing things right). </p><p> In <i>Whale Done!,</i> Ken Blanchard shows how to make accentuating the positive and redirecting the negative the best tools to increase productivity, instead of creating situations that demoralize people. These techniques are remarkably easy to master and can be applied equally well at home, allowing readers to become better parents and more committed spouses in their happier and more successful personal lives.</p>",196,2901,2000.0,130.0,Paperback,False,"Bringing Out the Best in People: How to Enjoy Helping Others Excel;The Fred Factor: How passion in your work and life can turn the ordinary into the extraordinary;How Full Is Your Bucket?;Fish!: A Remarkable Way to Boost Morale and Improve Results;Fish!

The book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally, igniting global conversations about women and ambition. Sandberg packed theatres, dominated opinion pages, appeared on every major television show and on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine, and sparked ferocious debate about women and leadership. Ask most women whether they have the right to equality at work and the answer will be a resounding yes, but ask the same women whether they'd feel confident asking for a raise, a promotion, or equal pay, and some reticence creeps in. The statistics, although an improvement on previous decades, are certainly not in women's favour – of 197 heads of state, only twenty-two are women. Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally, and in the world of big business, a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women. In <i>Lean In</i>, Sheryl Sandberg – Facebook COO and one of <i>Fortune</i> magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business – draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves, and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale.",12470,203112,2013.0,217.0,Hardcover,False,"Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office: 101 Unconscious Mistakes Women Make That Sabotage Their Careers;Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action;The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change;Who Moved My Cheese?;How to Win Friends and Influence People;The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business;Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die;Outliers: The Story of Success;Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking;Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything;The 4-Hour Workweek;Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future;The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses;The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable;Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity;Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies;Rich Dad, Poor Dad",non-fiction business nonfiction feminism favorites self-help leadership book-club women audiobook,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1364250803l/16071764._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1364250803l/16071764._SY160_.jpg

These companies still ignore the agile framework methodology or they have simply placed a taskboard in the centre of the office and stated ‘there, we are agile’. <br />While it is true that the agile methodology is not for everyone and not every software development project is suited to the framework it is, however, the way forward for the majority of companies who are involved in software development. <br />As agile has grown in popularity and usage over the decades the amount of literature about the subject has also grown. However most of the books currently available on the market focus on the project management or software development areas of the software development life cycle, there is still very little for the agile software tester to read. In the agile world; testing and the software tester are just as important as any other process or person and that is why I have written this book. Hopefully experienced and new testers alike will find some useful pointers within these humble pages which will help them enhance their career and enjoyment of testing software. <br />Test professionals involvement in agile projects remains challenged because of the very different nature of the agile methodology compared to older methodologies such as waterfall and the V model. This is also not helped by a level of misunderstanding about the true nature of agile that persists in many companies and deep-rooted prejudices aimed at testers by some programmers and project managers (they are nothing more than failed programmers being a common feeling). Although there are many test professionals succeeding in agile projects, many others continue to struggle to succeed and achieve their true potential that their skills and dedication deserve. Testers who have spent many years testing outside of agile can also often struggle to make the jump across the waterfall. However with quality training, good management and self-belief this jump can be completed, this is where the third edition of this book comes in.",3,8,2014.0,130.0,Paperback,False,None,testing software-testing,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

It is not an average self-help book that preaches life-enhancing methodologies based on complex science or long philosophical verses. The book’s genius lies in its simplicity. It offers quick, actionable and instantly applicable tips that will help readers lead better lives - instantly. The book begins with five ultra-practical steps that will help readers master their emotions. Emotions are strange. They make us human. They make our lives real. They make us different from robots. Yet, many disasters in our lives result from uncontrolled emotions or because of emotional wounds from painful experiences. By helping readers master their emotions, this book aims at making them strong, enabling them to make rational decisions. Readers will be trained on how to feel, face, control and protect their emotions. They will also be enlightened on the importance of EQ and how they can upgrade it. The book then acquaints readers with techniques of analyzing people through effective questioning in routine conversations and understanding personality traits. By applying these methods, readers can develop fruitful relationships at work and home. The third section of the book deals with living better lives with lesser resources. Using famous examples of Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg, readers are made to understand the value of simple living and high thinking. It will also help readers make the best first impressions and use non-verbal communication to their benefit. Next, readers are led into understanding the secret of happiness. It first explains how readers can attain divine happiness, how to tackle stress and depression and how to become happy in a jiffy. The book devotes an entire section to anger.

After writing three political thrillers, all of which helped me garner a bit of fame and intellectual fanbase, I was convinced that politics is perhaps the most difficult field a man can engage in. But then, matrimony came along and politics suddenly felt like the non-essential elaichi in this Mughlai Biryani called life. <br /> <br />When my ‘loved ones’ subjected me to scenarios unimaginable, when as the groom I had to wait for an hour for my baaraat to arrive, when certain ‘rituals’ scarred me with shame for the rest of my life, I so wanted to give it back to the society! And hence, ‘Lehengey and Lafdey’ was born. <br /> <br />LnL will raise your ire, tickle your funny bone, and show you everything except what a wedding is supposed to be: a sacred union. In a world filled with romantic novels, where love always wins in the end; patience, perseverance and the insane ability to bear a butt load of crap is required to emerge victorious in the holy war of matrimony. <br /> <br />Enough talk!

She has already hit the quintessential milestones of life, yet continues to look for the oasis, searching within her soulful realms for vistas unknown. Life is seldom all about the crust. It is an inexplicable amalgamation of memories, insights and the miniature droplets of self-realization we conjure on the way. The transcendence she experiences through her journey flips her back to the revered but concealed moments from lives gone by; she morphs from a jovial youngster to an enlightened soul, having inculcated the art of being in sync with the supreme Creator. Her trysts with the mystical lead her to making soul-stirring revelations. Discover how the protagonist’s life takes a 360 degree turn when she meets someone with whom she had spent 7200 life times? Experience how the experiences of her previous lifetimes imprint and control her present? Will Nuha be able to complete the puzzle of her deep-felt connection with the stranger?<br /><br />About the author: An author of two books-18 Real Life Stories Of Great Valour and Bravery and Vinegar and Honey For Perfect Harmony,and one audio book—Bharat Ke Bahadur Bachche, Nupur epitomizes the modern woman who dons many hats.

In 1917, after he returned home, Gandhi produced this extraordinary look at the plight of the poor in India, as prismed through the experience of a rail journey from Mumbai to Madras. From the filthy, overcrowded conditions in third class to his philosophical musings on the cures for what ailed the downtrodden of that nation, this brief, vital work offers a remarkable insight into the thinking of one of the 20th century's greatest heroes, and essential background for the acts that made him so powerful and so beloved.",66,911,1917.0,130.0,Paperback,False,India's Struggle for Independence;Nationalism;A Wasted Hour;India After Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy;Why I Am An Atheist: An Autobiographical Discourse;Leonardo da Vinci: A Life From Beginning to End;Yayati: A Classic Tale of Lust;Titanic: The Story About The Unsinkable Ship;The Accidental Prime Minister (The Making and Unmaking of Manmohan Singh);The Test of My Life;Word Power Made Easy;Short Stories From Rabindranath Tagore;Bali and the Ocean of Milk;The Off-site Tamasha;Why Do Men Fall Asleep After Sex?
