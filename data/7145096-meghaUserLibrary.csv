But what makes <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i> extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. <br /><br />Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.<br /><br />The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.<br /><br /><i>For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17229203-the-pillars-of-the-earth"" rel=""nofollow"">Alternate Cover Edition</a></i><br />",29941,608630,1989.0,976.0,True,"Memoirs of a Geisha;The Help;Outlander (Outlander, #1);La catedral del mar (La catedral del mar, #1);All the Light We Cannot See;Gone with the Wind;The Kite Runner;The Name of the Rose;Girl with a Pearl Earring;Water for Elephants;The Book Thief;The Boy in the Striped Pajamas;The Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children, #1);The Red Tent;The Other Boleyn Girl (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels, #9);Angels & Demons (Robert Langdon, #1);The Constant Princess (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels, #6);The Nightingale",historical-fiction favorites fiction historical owned books-i-own history series book-club medieval,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576956100l/5043._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576956100l/5043._SX98_.jpg

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.<br /><br />Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.<br /><br />Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.<br /><br />Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.<br /><br />In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another.

Yet there are moments of exquisite tenderness in these troubled lives. Georgette, the transvestite who falls in love with a callous hoodlum; Tralala, the conniving prostitute who plumbs the depths of sexual degradation; and Harry, the strike leader who hides his true desires behind a boorish masculinity, are unforgettable creations. <i>Last Exit to Brooklyn</i> was banned by British courts in 1967, a decision that was reversed the following year with the help of a number of writers and critics including Anthony Burgess and Frank Kermode.<br /><br />Hubert Selby, Jr. (1928-2004) was born in Brooklyn, New York. At the age of 15, he dropped out of school and went to sea with the merchant marines. While at sea he was diagnosed with lung disease. With no other way to make a living, he decided to try writing: 'I knew the alphabet. Maybe I could be a writer.' In 1964 he completed his first book, <i>Last Exit to Brooklyn</i>, which has since become a cult classic. In 1966, it was the subject of an obscenity trial in the UK. His other books include <i>The Room</i>, <i>The Demon</i>, <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>, <i>The Willow Tree</i> and <i>Waiting Period</i>. In 2000, <i>Requiem for a Dream</i> was adapted into a film starring Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn, and directed by Darren Aronofsky.<br /><br />'<i>Last Exit to Brooklyn</i> will explode like a rusty hellish bombshell over America, and still be eagerly read in 100 years'<br /><i>Allen Ginsberg</i><br /><br />'An urgent tickertape from hell'<br /><i>Spectator</i>",1128,23515,1964.0,290.0,False,Skagboys;Money;Crash;Lunar Park;Naked Lunch;Brighton Rock;The Zombie Room;Tampa;The Elephant Tree;Factotum;Trainspotting;The Bachman Books;Geek Love;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas;Invisible Monsters;The Wasp Factory;A Scanner Darkly;Post Office,fiction favorites classics owned thriller contemporary dark new-york american to-buy,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362815242l/50275._SX50_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362815242l/50275._SX98_.jpg

A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.<br /><br />Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.<br /><br />A groundbreaking work from a master, <i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i> is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out.

Is it possible to truly know who we are? Do our lives have a purpose, or are we just accidental? What are we meant to contribute? What are we meant to become, to create, and to share? In <i>The Book of Understanding</i>, Osho, one of the most provocative thinkers of our time, challenges us to understand our world and ourselves in a new and radical way. The first step toward understanding, he says, is to question and doubt all that we have been taught to believe.<br /><br />All our lives we’ve been handed so-called truths by countless others—beliefs we learned to accept without reason. It is only in questioning our beliefs, assumptions, and prejudices that we can begin to uncover our own unique voice and heal the divisions within us and without.<br /><br />Once we discover our authentic self, we can embrace all aspects of the human experience—from the earthy, pleasure-loving qualities that characterize Zorba the Greek to the watchful, silent qualities of Gautam the Buddha. We can become whole and live with integrity, able to respond with creativity and compassion to the religious, political, and cultural divides that currently plague our society.<br /><br />In this groundbreaking work, Osho identifies, loosens, and ultimately helps to untie the knots of fear and misunderstanding that restrict us—leaving us free to discover and create our own individual path to freedom.<br /><br /><br /><br />Doubt—because doubt is not a sin, it is the sign of your intelligence.<br /><br />You are not responsible to any nation, to any church, to any God. You are responsible only for one thing, and that is self-knowledge. And the miracle is, if you can fulfill this responsibility, you will be able to fulfill many other responsibilities without any effort. The moment you come to your own being, a revolution happens in your vision. Your whole outlook about life goes through a radical change. You start feeling new responsibilities—not as something to be done, not as duty to be fulfilled, but as a joy to do. <b>—OSHO</b><br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",36,615,2014.0,288.0,False,"The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare;The Lord of the Rings: The Art of The Fellowship of the Ring;Why There Is No God: Simple Responses to 20 Common Arguments for the Existence of God;Godless: How an Evangelical Preacher Became One of America's Leading Atheists;Divergent Series Complete Box Set (Divergent, #1-3);The Hobbit: Graphic Novel;The Lord of the Rings: The Making of the Movie Trilogy;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Visual Companion;A Manual for Creating Atheists;El libro salvaje;Conversaciones con mi guía;The Secret of Pembrooke Park;Conversations with God: An Uncommon Dialogue, Book 1;Being Happy!;How Life Works;The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams;Autobiography of a Yogi",osho spirituality favorites philosophy self-help spiritual non-fiction psychology personal-development spiritualità,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320432436l/97003._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320432436l/97003._SX98_.jpg

Over the course of seven nights, by the scattered light of a preposterous chandelier, Balram tells us the terrible and transfixing story of how he came to be a success in life—having nothing but his own wits to help him along. <br /><br />Born in the dark heart of India, Balram gets a break when he is hired as a driver for his village's wealthiest man, two house Pomeranians (Puddles and Cuddles), and the rich man's (very unlucky) son. From behind the wheel of their Honda City car, Balram's new world is a revelation. While his peers flip through the pages of Murder Weekly (""Love -- Rape -- Revenge!""), barter for girls, drink liquor (Thunderbolt), and perpetuate the Great Rooster Coop of Indian society, Balram watches his employers bribe foreign ministers for tax breaks, barter for girls, drink liquor (single-malt whiskey), and play their own role in the Rooster Coop. Balram learns how to siphon gas, deal with corrupt mechanics, and refill and resell Johnnie Walker Black Label bottles (all but one). He also finds a way out of the Coop that no one else inside it can perceive. <br /><br />Balram's eyes penetrate India as few outsiders can: the cockroaches and the call centers; the prostitutes and the worshippers; the ancient and Internet cultures; the water buffalo and, trapped in so many kinds of cages that escape is (almost) impossible, the white tiger. And with a charisma as undeniable as it is unexpected, Balram teaches us that religion doesn't create virtue, and money doesn't solve every problem -- but decency can still be found in a corrupt world, and you can get what you want out of life if you eavesdrop on the right conversations. <br /><br />The White Tiger recalls The Death of Vishnu and Bangkok 8 in ambition, scope, and narrative genius, with a mischief and personality all its own. Amoral, irreverent, deeply endearing, and utterly contemporary, this novel is an international publishing sensation —and a startling, provocative debut.",9650,148398,2008.0,320.0,False,"The God of Small Things;Train to Pakistan;The Inheritance of Loss;Five Point Someone: What Not to Do at IIT;The Immortals of Meluha (Shiva Trilogy, #1);2 States: The Story of My Marriage;The 3 Mistakes of My Life;The Secret of the Nagas (Shiva Trilogy #2);The Oath of the Vayuputras (Shiva Trilogy, #3);Malgudi Days;The Namesake;The Palace of Illusions;Shantaram;Midnight's Children;Sea of Poppies (Ibis Trilogy, #1);Revolution 2020: Love, Corruption, Ambition;Life of Pi;One Night at the Call Center",fiction india favorites book-club owned contemporary booker-prize indian books-i-own novels,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

Conn Iggulden is just such a writer, bringing to vivid life one of the most fascinating eras in human history. In a true masterpiece of historical fiction, Iggulden takes us on a breathtaking journey through ancient Rome, sweeping us into a realm of tyrants and slaves, of dark intrigues and seething passions. What emerges is both a grand romantic tale of coming-of-age in the Roman Empire and a vibrant portrait of the early years of a man who would become the most powerful ruler on earth: Julius Caesar. <br />On the lush Italian peninsula, a new empire is taking shape. At its heart is the city of Rome, a place of glory and decadence, beauty and bloodshed. Against this vivid backdrop, two boys are growing to manhood, dreaming of battles, fame, and glory in service of the mightiest empire the world has ever known. One is the son of a senator, a boy of privilege and ambition to whom much has been given and from whom much is expected. The other is a bastard child, a boy of strength and cunning, whose love for his adoptive family-and his adoptive brother-will be the most powerful force in his life. <br />As young Gaius and Marcus are trained in the art of combat-under the tutelage of one of Rome's most fearsome gladiators-Rome itself is being rocked by the art of treachery and ambition, caught in a tug-of-war as two rival generals, Marius and Sulla, push the empire toward civil war. For Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier's proving ground. For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will be the battlefield where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the love of an extraordinary slave girl will be an honor each will covet but only one will win. <br />The two friends are forced to walk different paths, and by the time they meet again everything will have changed. Both will have known love, loss, and violence. And the land where they were once innocent will be thrust into the grip of bitter conflict-a conflict that will set Roman against Roman...and put their friendship to the ultimate test. <br />Brilliantly interweaving history and adventure, Conn Iggulden conjures a stunning array of contrasts-from the bloody stench of a battlefield to the opulence of the greatest city in history, from the tenderness of a lover to the treachery of an assassin. Superbly rendered, grippingly told, Emperor, The Gates of Rome is a work of vaulting imagination from a powerful new voice in historical fiction.

""F**k positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.<br /><br />Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.<br /><br />There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear.

Once we can identify and understand what this quality of awareness is, we have the key to self-mastery in virtually every area of our lives.<br /><br />According to great masters like Lao Tzu or Buddha, most of us move through our lives like sleepwalkers. Never really present in what we are doing, never fully alert to our environment, and not even aware of what motivates us to do and say the things we do.<br /><br />At the same time, all of us have experienced moments of awareness-or awakening, to use another-in extraordinary circumstances. On the road, in a sudden and unexpected accident, time seems to stop and one is suddenly aware of every movement, every sound, every thought. Or in moments that touch us deeply-welcoming a new baby into the world for the first time, or being with someone at the moment of death.<br /><br />Awareness, says Osho, is the key to being self-directed, centered, and free in every aspect of our lives.

A keepsake enjoyed by tea lovers for over a hundred years, <i>The Book of Tea Classic Edition</i> will enhance your enjoyment and understanding of the seemingly simple act of making and drinking tea.</b><br /><br />In 1906 in turn-of-the-century Boston, a small, esoteric book about tea was written with the intention of being read aloud in the famous salon of Isabella Gardner, Boston's most notorious socialite. It was authored by Okakura Kakuzo, a Japanese philosopher, art expert, and curator. Little known at the time, Kakuzo would emerge as one of the great thinkers of the early 20th century, a genius who was insightful, witty—and greatly responsible for bridging Western and Eastern cultures. Okakura had been taught at a young age to speak English and was more than capable of expressing to Westerners the nuances of tea and the Japanese Tea Ceremony.<br /><br />In <i>The Book of Tea Classic Edition,</i> he discusses such topics as Zen and Taoism, but also the secular aspects of tea and Japanese life. The book emphasizes how Teaism taught the Japanese many things; most importantly, simplicity. Kakuzo argues that tea-induced simplicity affected the culture, art and architecture of Japan.<br /><br />Nearly a century later, Kakuzo's <i>The Book of Tea Classic Edition</i> is still beloved the world over, making it an essential part of any tea enthusiast's collection. Interwoven with a rich history of Japanese tea and its place in Japanese society is a poignant commentary on Asian culture and our ongoing fascination with it, as well as illuminating essays on art, spirituality, poetry, and more. <i>The Book of Tea Classic Edition</i> is a delightful cup of enlightenment from a man far ahead of his time.",912,8951,1906.0,133.0,False,"A Cup of Sake Beneath the Cherry Trees;In Praise of Shadows;Tea Life, Tea Mind;Wabi-Sabi: For Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers;Reflections on Japanese Taste: The Structure of Iki;Love that Moves the Sun and Other Stars;Aphorisms on Love and Hate;Why I Am So Wise;The Japanese Way of Tea: From Its Origins in China to Sen Rikyu;Olive: A Global History;Of Dogs and Walls;The Narrow Road to the Deep North and Other Travel Sketches (Yuasa);Three Tang Dynasty Poets;Wabi-Sabi: Further Thoughts;Three Japanese Short Stories;Bushido: The Soul of Japan.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Murakami lived abroad until 1995. That year, two disasters struck Japan: the lethal earthquake in Kobe and the deadly poison gas attacks in the Tokyo subway. Spurred by these tragic events, Murakami returned home. The stories in <i>After the Quake</i> are set in the months that fell between the earthquake and the subway attack, presenting a world marked by despair, hope, and a kind of human instinct for transformation. A teenage girl and a middle-aged man share a hobby of making beach bonfires; a businesswoman travels to Thailand and, quietly, confronts her own death; three friends act out a modern-day Tokyo version of <i>Jules and Jim</i>. There's a surreal element running through the collection in the form of unlikely frogs turning up in unlikely places. News of the earthquake hums throughout. The book opens with the dull buzz of disaster-watching: ""Five straight days she spent in front of the television, staring at the crumbled banks and hospitals, whole blocks of stores in flames, severed rail lines and expressways."" With language that's never self-consciously lyrical or show-offy, Murakami constructs stories as tight and beautiful as poems. There's no turning back for his people; there's only before and after the quake. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>",2620,35529,2000.0,132.0,False,"Kitchen;Haruki Murakami and the Music of Words;Haruki Murakami Interviews: How Murakami thinks?;White Man/Yellow Man: Two Novellas;The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea;The Briefcase;In the Miso Soup;コンビニ人間 [Konbini ningen];Kokoro;Brother, I'm Dying;The Woman in the Dunes;Confessions of a Mask;A Personal Matter;Patience;Un lup atârna în cais, cu capul în jos: povestiri;Dante and the Lobster;Sanshirō;The Forbidden Worlds of Haruki Murakami",short-stories fiction japan japanese murakami favorites japanese-literature magical-realism haruki-murakami owned,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1445871741l/17256597._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1445871741l/17256597._SX98_.jpg

She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. <br /><br />To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly. <br /><br />An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery, Eat, Pray, Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals.

Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.<br /><br />The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, “each the other’s world entire,” are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.<br />(front flap)",43744,671260,2006.0,241.0,False,"Slaughterhouse-Five;Brave New World;Catch-22 (Catch-22, #1);Life of Pi;Of Mice and Men;The Catcher in the Rye;Fahrenheit 451;1984;World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War;Lord of the Flies;Fight Club;Animal Farm;A Clockwork Orange;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time;On the Road;The Old Man and the Sea;The Great Gatsby;The Kite Runner",fiction favorites science-fiction dystopia dystopian post-apocalyptic sci-fi owned books-i-own classics,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439197219l/6288._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1439197219l/6288._SY160_.jpg

But he’s harboring a secret from his daughter, a love affair he’s keeping all to himself. In “A Choice of Accommodations,” a husband’s attempt to turn an old friend’s wedding into a romantic getaway weekend with his wife takes a dark, revealing turn as the party lasts deep into the night. In “Only Goodness,” a sister eager to give her younger brother the perfect childhood she never had is overwhelmed by guilt, anguish, and anger when his alcoholism threatens her family. And in “Hema and Kaushik,” a trio of linked stories—a luminous, intensely compelling elegy of life, death, love, and fate—we follow the lives of a girl and boy who, one winter, share a house in Massachusetts.

But because he is attuned to the nascent conservative backlash against the therapeutic worldview, Peck also cites Gospel passages, recruits psychotherapy to the cause of traditional religion (he even convinces a patient to sign up for divinity school) and insists that problems must be overcome through suffering, discipline and hard work (with a therapist.) Often departing from the cerebral and rationalistic bent of Freudian discourse for a mystical, Jungian tone more compatible with New Age spirituality, Peck writes of psychotherapy as an exercise in ""love"" and ""spiritual growth,"" asserts that ""our unconscious is God"" and affirms his belief in miracles, reincarnation and telepathy. Peck's synthesis of such clashing elements (he even throws in a little thermodynamics) is held together by a warm and lucid discussion of psychiatric principles and moving accounts of his own patients' struggles and breakthroughs. Harmonizing psychoanalysis and spirituality, Christ and Buddha, Calvinist work ethic and interminable talking cures, this book is a touchstone of our contemporary religio-therapeutic culture."" -- Publishers WeeklyKeywords: MIND &amp; BODY PSYCHOLOGY SOCIOLOGY RELIGION",2192,79105,1978.0,316.0,False,"The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment;The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams;I'm OK - You're OK;On Death and Dying;The Secret (The Secret, #1);A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose;A Course in Miracles;The Art of Loving;Man's Search for Meaning;Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus;The Art of Happiness;Games People Play;The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom;Anatomy of the Spirit: The Seven Stages of Power and Healing;Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ;The Power of Positive Thinking;The Celestine Prophecy (Celestine Prophecy, #1);The Seat of the Soul",psychology non-fiction self-help spirituality favorites nonfiction philosophy spiritual self-improvement personal-development,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1322673263l/347852._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1322673263l/347852._SX98_.jpg

His writing is in some ways reminiscent of Rimbaud, while he himself has often been called a forerunner of Yukio Mishima.<br /><br /><i>Cover painting by Noe Nojechowiz, from the collection of John and Barbara Duncan; design by Gertrude Huston</i>",1367,16185,1948.0,176.0,False,Kokoro;The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea;Confessions of a Mask;No Longer Human;The Temple of the Golden Pavilion;Botchan;Snow Country;Spring Snow;A Personal Matter;I Am a Cat;The Poems of Nakahara Chuya;The Woman in the Dunes;Kappa;Rashomon and Other Stories;Rashōmon and Seventeen Other Stories;文豪ストレイドッグス 太宰治の入社試験 [Bungō Stray Dogs Dazai Osamu no Nyūsha Shiken];Norwegian Wood;Naomi,favorites fiction japan japanese japanese-literature classics japanese-lit literature owned favourites,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422638843l/194746._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422638843l/194746._SX98_.jpg

It could be a ""good crop.""<br />Thus begins the new novel from John Grisham, a story inspired by his own childhood in rural Arkansas. The narrator is a farm boy named Luke Chandler, age seven, who lives in the cotton fields with his parents and grandparents in a little house that's never been painted. The Chandlers farm eighty acres that they rent, not own, and when the cotton is ready they hire a truckload of Mexicans and a family from the Ozarks to help harvest it.<br /><br />For six weeks they pick cotton, battling the heat, the rain, the fatigue, and sometimes each other. As the weeks pass Luke sees and hears things no seven-year-old could possibly be prepared for, and he finds himself keeping secrets that not only threaten the crop but will change the lives of the Chandlers forever. <br /><br />©2000, 2001 Belfry Holdings, Inc.

The first major English language publication from the most popular bestselling writer in Japan, it was acclaimed as “stunning,” “brilliant,” and “ingenious.” Now physics professor Manabu Yukawa—Detective Galileo—returns in a new case of impossible murder, where instincts clash with facts and theory with reality.<br /><br />Yoshitaka, who was about to leave his marriage and his wife, is poisoned by arsenic-laced coffee and dies.

Thanks to the support from readers, this is the second episode of “Let’s Learn Japanese with Nini”. <br /> <br />Before we jump to the story, let me tell you how this book was made. One day, my wife and I decided to make Chinese-Japanese bilingual picture books for our own daughters to teach them Chinese. <br /> <br />My wife and I have a 7-year old daughter and a 2-year old daughter. But since we live in Japan, they have only limited exposure to Chinese language. Then, we though that since they both like to read books, it would be a good idea to make Chinese-Japanese bilingual picture books and read them together. So, first, I originally made a Japanese-Chinese version “Let’s Learn Chinese with Nini’s Picture Book 猜猜我是谁(Guess Who I Am).” Then, I thought that I could make Japanese-English versions as well. So, this is how this book was made. <br /> <br />This book might be useful for you if you… <br /> <br />-are thinking about starting to learn Japanese or have recently started to learn Japanese. <br />-are thinking about teaching Japanese to your children. <br />-want to read short, easy-to-understand, and enjoyable stories in Japanese. <br /> <br />At the end of some pages, there are also brief grammar explanations as well, so you don’t need to know much of Japanese grammar either. I will introduce the Japanese grammar little by little in later stories of this series. So you’ll learn Japanese grammar gradually. <br />",4,44,2014.0,240.0,False,"Inheritance (The Inheritance Cycle, #4);The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia;Heart and Brain: An Awkward Yeti Collection;The Road Less Traveled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth;The Holy Bible: English Standard Version;Japanese Demystified;Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life;Cultura japonesa: El Sol naciente (1);The Forgotten Garden;Fata care citea în metrou;The House of the Spirits;Am I Small?

Just ask the young cynic Shogo, who sinned against love. Electroshock therapy was only meant to bring him face to face with his own violent misdeeds, but instead landed him in the court of a stern goddess. <br /><br />If the encounter was a hallucination, then it's a hallucination that starts to encroach on reality in this unforgettable tale penned by manga-god Osamu Tezuka and inspired by Greek myths of divine unforgiving. Sharing with his longer work <i>Phoenix</i> the themes of recurrence and retribution as well as the spirit of high invention, <i>Apollo's Song</i> explores the meaning of love and the consequences of its absence. <br /><br />Shogo's mother is a bar hostess, his father could be any one of a dozen of her regular patrons. Growing up, he learns nothing of genuine love and tenderness, and when he witnesses his mother in the nearest approximation of which she's capable--lustful embrace--he receives a merciless beating soon afterwards. Shogo comes to hate the very notion of love. But goddesses, who are neither the Buddha nor Christ, do not excuse misfortunes of upbringing. <br /><br /><i>Apollo's Song</i> reaches Olympian heights of tragedy as the story proceeds from a boxcar bound for a Nazi concentration camp to a dystopian future where human beings are persecuted by an ascendant race of their own clones. Will Shogo ever attain redemption, or, like the human race itself, will he have to relearn the lessons of love forever? Is it better to have loved and lost if the heartbreak must recur eternally?<br /><br />Love, propagation, nature, war, death--Tezuka holds his trademark cornucopia of concerns together with striking characterizations, an unfailing sense of pacing, and of course, stunning imagery. <br /><br />Though marked by a salty pessimism, this unique masterpiece from Tezuka's transitional period is also unabashedly romantic--and, at times, profoundly erotic. Combining a classic tale of thwarted love with cognitive ambiguities reminiscent of the work of Philip K. Dick, <i>Apollo's Song</i> is guaranteed to plumb new depths of the human heart with each rereading.",117,1150,1970.0,541.0,True,"Solanin (Solanin, #1-2);The Key;Junji Ito's Dissolving Classroom;ハピネス 1 (Happiness, #1);Bizarre Romance;Patient: The True Story of a Rare Illness;とんがり帽子のアトリエ 1 [Tongari bōshi no atelier 1];Quartier lointain;The Essential Haiku: Versions of Basho, Buson, and Issa;Get Jiro!;The Tale of Genji: Scenes from the World's First Novel (Illustrated Japanese Classics);Dead Inside: Do Not Enter: Notes from the Zombie Apocalypse;Ministry of Moral Panic;The Challenge of Things: Thinking Through Troubled Times;Dragon Ball, Vol. 4: Strongest Under the Heavens (Dragon Ball, #4);The Promised Neverland - Chapter 1;Abandon the Old in Tokyo;Domu: A Child's Dream",manga comics graphic-novels graphic-novel fiction fantasy romance favorites science-fiction owned,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327878220l/534308._SX50_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327878220l/534308._SX98_.jpg

His stunning first novel, The Notebook, has been given by friend to friend and lover to lover all over the world as a testament to the timeless power of love. But if we thought he could never again move us so deeply, he now shows us he can-in a story that renews our faith in destiny...in the ability of true lovers to find each other no matter where, no matter when... Message In A Bottle <br /><br />Thrown to the waves, and to fate, the bottle could have ended up anywhere. Instead, it is found just three weeks after it begins its journey. Theresa Osborne, divorced and the mother of a twelve-year-old son, picks it up during a seaside vacation from her job as a Boston newspaper columnist. Inside is a letter that opens with: <br /><br />My Dearest Catherine, I miss you my darling, as I always do, but today is particularly hard because the ocean has been singing to me, and the song is that of our life together... <br /><br />For ""Garrett,"" the man who signs the letter, the message is the only way he knows to express his undying love for a woman he has lost. For Theresa, wary of romance since her husband shattered her trust, the message raises questions that intrigue her. Who are Garrett and Catherine? Where is he now? What is his story? <br /><br />Challenged by the mystery, and pulled to find Garrett by emotions she does not fully understand, Theresa begins a search that takes her to a sunlit coastal town and an unexpected confrontation. Brought together by chance-or something more powerful-Theresa and Garrett are people whose lives are about to touch for a purpose, in a tale that resonates with our deepest hopes for finding that special someone and everlasting love. <br /><br />Shimmering with suspense and emotional intensity, Message in a Bottle takes readers on a hunt for the truth about a man and his memories, and about both the heartbreaking fragility and enormous strength of love.

Though critically acclaimed, it was largely ignored upon its initial publication. Yet soon it became a cult favorite among both students and literary critics who compared it to J.D. Salinger's <b>The Catcher in the Rye</b> in its influence on modern thought and literature.<br /><br />William Golding's compelling story about a group of very ordinary small boys marooned on a coral island has become a modern classic. At first it seems as though it is all going to be great fun; but the fun before long becomes furious and life on the island turns into a nightmare of panic and death. As ordinary standards of behaviour collapse, the whole world the boys know collapses with them—the world of cricket and homework and adventure stories—and another world is revealed beneath, primitive and terrible. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, <b>Lord of the Flies</b> has established itself as a true classic.<br /><br />""<b>
