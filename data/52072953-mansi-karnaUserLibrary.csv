The time is bound to people who are forced to fall in love by a series of time events.<br /><br /><br />Time lets us heal. It lets us grow. It allows us to see the impact of decisions we take. But what if there is a situation where we don’t exactly know what kind of decision to take? Is it not better enough to leave the consequences to time?<br /><br /><br />WoooW! Lot said already!

It is for a reason that very easily the efforts put in to write a haiku might go plain and senseless. Like, they might just become a set of words which do not speak out the message which they were intended to. Though they are in the structure of three lines, they can speak a book of stories.

This book is the fourth one in series of the poems I have pen down. The first one was ‘P for Poetry’ which gave me the ‘go good’ feeling. Second one ‘Poetic Desk’ gave me the ability to see and pen down poems with dept. Then came ‘100 Haiku’ where I enjoyed writing haiku and the stories they tell in three lines.<br /><br /><br />This one, ‘Poem Shop’ has most of my favorites. There are around ten limericks too which make up to a total of 25 poems. There is no specific genre of titles. It surrounds the emotions and thoughts of day to day life.

A chimera.<br />After years of abuse and rejection, 19-year-old Evelyn Kingston is ready for a fresh start in a new city, where no one knows her name. The esteemed Billington University in sunny Southern California seems like the perfect place to reinvent herself—to live the life of an ordinary human.<br /><br />But things at Billington aren’t as they seem. In a school filled with prodigies, socialites, and the leaders of tomorrow, Eve finds that the complex social hierarchy makes passing as a human much harder than she had anticipated. Even worse, Billington is harboring a secret of its own: Interlopers have infiltrated the university, and their sinister plans are targeted at chimeras—like Eve. <br /><br />Instantly, Eve’s new life takes a drastic turn. In a time filled with chaos, is the world focusing on the wrong enemy?
