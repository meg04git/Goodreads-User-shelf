0,124432,White Mughals: Love and Betrayal in Eighteenth-Century India,014200412X,William Dalrymple,2004,Penguin Books,eng,"<b>White Mughals</b> is the romantic and ultimately tragic tale of a passionate love affair that crossed and transcended all the cultural, religious and political boundaries of its time.James Achilles Kirkpatrick was the British Resident at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad when in 1798 he glimpsed Kahir un-Nissa—'Most excellent among Women'—the great-niece of the Nizam's Prime Minister and a descendant of the Prophet. Kirkpatrick had gone out to India as an ambitious soldier in the army of the East India Company, eager to make his name in the conquest and subjection of the subcontinent. Instead, he fell in love with Khair and overcame many obstacles to marry her—not least of which was the fact that she was locked away in purdah and engaged to a local nobleman. Eventually, while remaining Resident, Kirkpatrick converted to Islam, and according to Indian sources even became a double-agent working for the Hyderabadis against the East India Company.<br /><br />It is a remarkable story, involving secret assignations, court intrigue, harem politics, religious and family disputes. But such things were not unknown; from the early sixteenth century, when the Inquisition banned the Portuguese in Goa from wearing the dhoti, to the eve of the Indian mutiny, the 'white Mughals' who wore local dress and adopted Indian ways were a source of embarrassments to successive colonial administrations. William Dalrymple unearths such colourful figures as 'Hindoo Stuart', who travelled with his own team of Brahmins to maintain his temple of idols, and who spent many years trying to persuade the memsahibs of Calcutta to adopt the sari; and Sir David Ochterlony, Kirkpatrick's counterpart in Delhi, who took all thirteen of his wives out for evening promenades, each on the back of their own elephant.<br /><br />In <b>White Mughals</b>, William Dalrymple discovers a world almost entirely unexplored by history, and places at its centre a compelling tale of love, seduction and betrayal. It possesses all the sweep and resonance of a great nineteenth-century novel, set against a background of shifting alliances and the manoeuvring of the great powers, the mercantile ambitions of the British and the imperial dreams of Napoleon. <b>White Mughals</b>, the product of five years' writing and research, triumphantly confirms Dalrymple's reputation as one of the finest writers at work today.",302,3788,2002,580,Paperback,False,"India After Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy;Indian Summer: The Secret History of the End of an Empire;Freedom at Midnight;River of Smoke;Sea of Poppies (Ibis Trilogy, #1);The Lives of Others;Flood of Fire;Early Indians: The Story of Our Ancestors and Where We Came From;Train to Pakistan;Rebel Sultans: The Deccan from Khilji to Shivaji;A History of India, Vol. 1: From Origins to 1300 (A History of India #1);The Glass Palace;Midnight's Children;The Moor's Last Sigh;The Music Room;The Spy Chronicles: RAW, ISI and the Illusion of Peace;India Unbound: The Social and Economic Revolution from Independence to the Global Information Age;The Hungry Tide",history india non-fiction nonfiction owned favorites historical-fiction fiction biography books-i-own,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309285574l/124432._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309285574l/124432._SX98_.jpg

0,124429,"The Last Mughal: The Fall of a Dynasty: Delhi, 1857",1400043107,William Dalrymple,2007,Alfred A. Knopf,eng,"On a hazy November afternoon in Rangoon, 1862, a shrouded corpse was escorted by a small group of British soldiers to an anonymous grave in a prison enclosure. As the British Commissioner in charge insisted, “No vestige will remain to distinguish where the last of the Great Moghuls rests.” <br /><br />Bahadur Shah Zafar II, the last Mughal Emperor, was a mystic, an accomplished poet and a skilled calligrapher. But while his Mughal ancestors had controlled most of India, the aged Zafar was king in name only. Deprived of real political power by the East India Company, he nevertheless succeeded in creating a court of great brilliance, and presided over one of the great cultural renaissances of Indian history.<br /><br />Then, in 1857, Zafar gave his blessing to a rebellion among the Company’s own Indian troops, thereby transforming an army mutiny into the largest uprising any empire had to face in the entire course of the nineteenth century. The Siege of Delhi was the Raj’s Stalingrad: one of the most horrific events in the history of Empire, in which thousands on both sides died. And when the British took the city—securing their hold on the subcontinent for the next ninety years—tens of thousands more Indians were executed, including all but two of Zafar’s sixteen sons. By the end of the four-month siege, Delhi was reduced to a battered, empty ruin, and Zafar was sentenced to exile in Burma. There he died, the last Mughal ruler in a line that stretched back to the sixteenth century.<br /><br />Award-winning historian and travel writer William Dalrymple shapes his powerful retelling of this fateful course of events from groundbreaking material: previously unexamined Urdu and Persian manuscripts that include Indian eyewitness accounts and records of the Delhi courts, police and administration during the siege. <i>The Last Mughal</i> is a revelatory work—the first to present the Indian perspective on the fall of Delhi—and has as its heart both the dazzling capital personified by Zafar and the stories of the individuals tragically caught up in one of the bloodiest upheavals in history.",477,6028,2006,534,Hardcover,False,"Indian Summer: The Secret History of the End of an Empire;Freedom at Midnight;India After Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy;India: A History;India's Struggle for Independence;The Discovery of India;Empires of the Indus: The Story of a River;The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History, Culture and Identity;Rebel Sultans: The Deccan from Khilji to Shivaji;India: A Million Mutinies Now;Victoria's Wars: The Rise of Empire;The Serpent's Tooth (Empire of the Moghul, #5);The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan;In Spite of the Gods: The Strange Rise of Modern India;India Since Independence;Swimming Lessons and Other Stories from Firozsha Baag;India Unbound: The Social and Economic Revolution from Independence to the Global Information Age;Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi",history india non-fiction nonfiction biography favorites indian-history asia owned default,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320556054l/124429._SX50_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320556054l/124429._SX98_.jpg

First he learned that his cousin Edward was secretly meeting with a real estate agent about their late grandfather’s magnificent West Village brownstone, despite the promise they both made to keep it in the family. Then, when he went to the house to confront Edward about it, he got a blunt object to the back of the head.<br /><br />Luckily Dennis is married to Charlotte Mira, the NYPSD’s top profiler and a good friend of Lieutenant Eve Dallas. When the two arrive on the scene, he explains that the last thing he saw was Edward in a chair, bruised and bloody. When he came to, his cousin was gone. With the mess cleaned up and the security disks removed, there’s nothing left behind but a few traces for forensics to analyze. <br /><br />As a former lawyer, judge, and senator, Edward Mira mingled with the elite and crossed paths with criminals, making enemies on a regular basis. Like so many politicians, he also made some very close friends behind closed—and locked—doors. But a badge and a billionaire husband can get you into places others can’t go, and Eve intends to shine some light on the dirty deals and dark motives behind the disappearance of a powerful man, the family discord over a multimillion-dollar piece of real estate . . . and a new case that no one saw coming.",1749,20824,2016,388,Hardcover,True,"Concealed in Death: by J.

Rowling,2006,Scholastic Inc.,eng,"When Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince opens, the war against Voldemort has begun. The Wizarding world has split down the middle, and as the casualties mount, the effects even spill over onto the Muggles. Dumbledore is away from Hogwarts for long periods, and the Order of the Phoenix has suffered grievous losses. And yet, as in all wars, life goes on.<br /><br />Harry, Ron, and Hermione, having passed their O.W.L. level exams, start on their specialist N.E.W.T. courses. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, losing a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Harry becomes captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, while Draco Malfoy pursues his own dark ends. And classes are as fascinating and confounding as ever, as Harry receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.<br /><br />Most importantly, Dumbledore and Harry work together to uncover the full and complex story of a boy once named Tom Riddle—the boy who became Lord Voldemort. Like Harry, he was the son of one Muggle-born and one Wizarding parent, raised unloved, and a speaker of Parseltongue. But the similarities end there, as the teenaged Riddle became deeply interested in the Dark objects known as Horcruxes: objects in which a wizard can hide part of his soul, if he dares splinter that soul through murder.<br /><br />Harry must use all the tools at his disposal to draw a final secret out of one of Riddle’s teachers, the sly Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Finally Harry and Dumbledore hold the key to the Dark Lord’s weaknesses... until a shocking reversal exposes Dumbledore’s own vulnerabilities, and casts Harry’s—and Hogwarts’s—future in shadow.<br /><br />Source: <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://harrypotter.scholastic.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harrypotter.scholastic.com</a>",35559,2240476,2005,652,Paperback,True,"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: Parts One and Two (Harry Potter, #8);Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, #3);Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, #2);New Moon (Twilight, #2);Eclipse (Twilight, #3);Breaking Dawn (Twilight, #4);The Two Towers (The Lord of the Rings, #2);The Return of the King (The Lord of the Rings, #3);The Hobbit, or There and Back Again;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (Hogwarts Library);The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon, #2);The Sea of Monsters (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #2);Insurgent (Divergent, #2);Quidditch Through the Ages (Hogwarts Library);The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1);The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1);The Last Olympian (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #5);The Chronicles of Narnia (Chronicles of Narnia, #1-7)",fantasy favorites young-adult fiction harry-potter books-i-own owned ya series favourites,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361039191l/1._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361039191l/1._SX98_.jpg

0,1769362,The Arthashastra,0140446036,Chanakya,1992,Penguin Books India,eng,"The Arthashastra is an ancient Indian treatise on statecraft, economic policy and military strategy, written in Sanskrit. It identifies its author by the names 'Kauṭilya' and 'Vishnugupta', both names that are traditionally identified with Chanakya (c. 350–283 BC), who was a scholar at Takshashila and the teacher and guardian of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Mauryan Empire. The text was influential until the 12th century, when it disappeared. It was rediscovered in 1904 by R. Shamasastry, who published it in 1909. The first English translation was published in 1915.<br /><br />Roger Boesche describes the Arthaśāstra as ""a book of political realism, a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good.""<br /><br />Centrally, Arthaśāstra argues how in an autocracy an efficient and solid economy can be managed. It discusses the ethics of economics and the duties and obligations of a king. The scope of Arthaśāstra is, however, far wider than statecraft, and it offers an outline of the entire legal and bureaucratic framework for administering a kingdom, with a wealth of descriptive cultural detail on topics such as mineralogy, mining and metals, agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine and the use of wildlife. The Arthaśāstra also focuses on issues of welfare (for instance, redistribution of wealth during a famine) and the collective ethics that hold a society together.",47,795,-200,878,Hardcover,False,"The Discovery of India;Savarkar: Echoes from a Forgotten Past, 1883–1924;Understanding Operation Enduring Freedom: Afghanistan 2001-2014;On the Trail of a Lion;Second Treatise of Government;Annihilation of Caste;My Gita;Tao Te Ching;Our Lady of Alice Bhatti;Wings of Fire: An Autobiography;The Social Contract and Discourses;Considerations on Representative Government;George Washington's Farewell Address;Small Wars Manual;International Security: Politics, Policy, Prospects;Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans;The Dhammapada;Train to Pakistan",non-fiction politics history philosophy economics india classics strategy political-science business,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911. <br /> <br />The plot centers round Mary Lennox, a young English girl who returns to England from India, having suffered the immense trauma by losing both her parents in a cholera epidemic. However, her memories of her parents are not pleasant, as they were a selfish, neglectful and pleasure-seeking couple. Mary is given to the care of her uncle Archibald Craven, whom she has never met. She travels to his home, Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire, a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives, she is a rude, stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However, her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he's away from home, Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked. The mystery deepens when she hears sounds of sobbing from somewhere within her uncle's vast mansion. The kindly servants ignore her queries or pretend they haven't heard, spiking Mary's curiosity. <br /> <br />The Secret Garden appeals to both young and old alike. It has wonderful elements of mystery, spirituality, charming characters and an authentic rendering of childhood emotions and experiences. Commonsense, truth and kindness, compassion and a belief in the essential goodness of human beings lie at the heart of this unforgettable story. It is the best known of Frances Hodgson Burnett's works, though most of us have definitely heard of, if not read, her other novel Little Lord Fauntleroy. <br /> <br />The book has been adapted extensively on stage, film and television and translated into all the world's major languages. In 1991, a Japanese anime version was launched for television in Japan. It remains a popular and beloved story of a child's journey into maturity, and a must-read for every child, parent, teacher and anyone who would enjoy this fascinating glimpse of childhood. One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance.

His death would typically drop to the bottom of a list of senseless and inexplicable killings, but Lieutenant Dallas, who ""would stand for the dead and the living,"" is not about to let that happen. When her research uncovers similar crimes in several cities that were dropped under mysterious circumstances, Dallas knows she's facing a killer cruel enough to prey on the weakest in society and powerful enough to conspire an extensive coverup. To complicate matters further, Dallas faces an equally troubling threat to her career when she's linked to the death of a fellow cop. Now she must fight to restore her good name as well as track down the killer. <br /><br />In Conspiracy in Death, Roberts creates a futuristic world of evil that Eve Dallas negotiates through tough talk and brute force.

And for the first time, Peabody is primary detective on the case, which means she has to get used to a new level of authority and responsibility. Good thing she learned the ropes from a master like Eve.<br /><br />But after rounding up the perps, Peabody stumbles upon a much trickier situation. Determined to start working out as hard as she grills suspects, she chooses to do it at the old, rarely-used gym at Central. After a grueling workout, she squeezes into one of the narrow shower stalls, happy to have the place to herself. Just after she shuts the water off, the gym door clatters open — and while she cringes inside the stall, trying not to make a sound, Peabody overhears two fellow officers, Garnet and Oberman, arguing. References are made to delivering product, and a house in the islands, and someone named Keener who’s supposed to look like an OD. It doesn’t take long for a naked and vulnerable Peabody to realize that both officers are crooked — guilty not just of corruption but of murder as well. Fortunately, the two clear out of the locker room without realizing there was a witness.<br /><br />Eve Dallas may have trained Peabody well — but this is too dangerous for one person to take on alone. Now Peabody, Eve, and her husband, Roarke, must try to get the hard evidence they need to bring the dirty cops down — knowing all the while that the two have already killed to keep their secret, and are no doubt willing to do it again.<br /><br />11 Audio CDs / 13 Hours 14 mins <br /><br />~",1277,23792,2011,375,,True,"Chasing Fire;In Too Deep (Arcane Society, #10; Looking Glass Trilogy, #1);Festive in Death: by JD Robb | Summary & Analysis;Hiding in the Shadows (Bishop/Special Crimes Unit #2; Shadows #2);Silver Master (Ghost Hunters, #4);Hot Rocks;Concealed in Death: by J.

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.<br /><br />Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.<br /><br />source: georgerrmartin.com",52733,1872282,1996,835,Mass Market Paperback,True,"The Hobbit, or There and Back Again;The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1);Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter, #1);The Hobbit, Part One;A Game of Thrones #1;Eragon (The Inheritance Cycle, #1);The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1);The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1);The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Chronicles of Narnia, #1);Twilight (Twilight, #1);Angels & Demons (Robert Langdon, #1);The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #1);1984;The Golden Compass (His Dark Materials, #1);Ender's Game (Ender's Saga, #1);Dune (Dune, #1);BookRags Summary:  A Storm of Swords;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter, #7)",fantasy favorites fiction owned books-i-own series favourites epic-fantasy kindle sci-fi-fantasy,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562726234l/13496._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562726234l/13496._SY160_.jpg

Robb,,,eng,"The death of history teacher Craig Foster devastated his young wife, who’d sent him off to work that morning with a lovingly packed lunch. It shocked his colleagues at the Upper West Side private school. And as for the ten-year-old girls who found him in his classroom in a pool of bodily fluids, they may have been traumatized for life.<br /><br />Lieutenant Eve Dallas, of course, is more hardened to murder cases. And this is clearly a murder case. That lovingly packed lunch was tainted with deadly ricin. And Mr. Foster’s colleagues, shocked as they may be, have some shocking secrets of their own. It’s Eve’s job to get a feel for all the potential suspects, and find out why someone would have done this to a man who seemed so inoffensive, so pleasant…so innocent.<br /><br />Now Magdelana Percell – there’s someone Eve can picture as a murder victim. Possibly at Eve’s own hands. The slinky blonde - an old flame of her billionaire husband, Roarke, from his days on the wrong side of the law – has turned up in New York, and she’s anything but innocent. Unfortunately, Roarke seems blind to Magdelana’s manipulation, but not to her shapely figure and flirtatious ways. And he insists that the occasional lunch or business meeting with her is nothing to worry about…and none of Eve’s business. Eve’s so unnerved by the situation that she finds it hard to focus on the Foster case. Still, she’ll have to put aside her anger, jealousy, and heartbreak, for a while at least - because another man has just turned up dead, and the case is taking some strange turns and hitting some frustrating dead ends.<br /><br />Eve knows all too well that innocence can be a façade.

Salinger,2001,Back Bay Books,eng,"The hero-narrator of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. <br /><br />J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951.
