  <b>From the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters who broke the news of Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment and abuse for the <i>New York Times</i>, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the thrilling untold story of their investigation and its consequences for the #MeToo movement</b>
</b><br /><br />For many years, reporters had tried to get to the truth about Harvey Weinstein's treatment of women. Rumors of wrongdoing had long circulated. But in 2017, when Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey began their investigation into the prominent Hollywood producer for the <i>New York Times</i>, his name was still synonymous with power. During months of confidential interviews with top actresses, former Weinstein employees, and other sources, many disturbing and long-buried allegations were unearthed, and a web of onerous secret payouts and nondisclosure agreements was revealed. These shadowy settlements had long been used to hide sexual harassment and abuse, but with a breakthrough reporting technique Kantor and Twohey helped to expose it. But Weinstein had evaded scrutiny in the past, and he was not going down without a fight; he employed a team of high-profile lawyers, private investigators, and other allies to thwart the investigation. When Kantor and Twohey were finally able to convince some sources to go on the record, a dramatic final showdown between Weinstein and the <i>New York Times</i> was set in motion.<br /><br />Nothing could have prepared Kantor and Twohey for what followed the publication of their initial Weinstein story on October 5, 2017. Within days, a veritable Pandora's box of sexual harassment and abuse was opened. Women all over the world came forward with their own traumatic stories. Over the next twelve months, hundreds of men from every walk of life and industry were outed following allegations of wrongdoing. But did too much change--or not enough? Those questions hung in the air months later as Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford came forward to testify that he had assaulted her decades earlier. Kantor and Twohey, who had unique access to Ford and her team, bring to light the odyssey that led her to come forward, the overwhelming forces that came to bear on her, and what happened after she shared her allegation with the world.<br /><br />In the tradition of great investigative journalism, <i>She Said</i> tells a thrilling story about the power of truth, with shocking new information from hidden sources. Kantor and Twohey describe not only the consequences of their reporting for the #MeToo movement, but the inspiring and affecting journeys of the women who spoke up--for the sake of other women, for future generations, and for themselves.",1449,11837,2019.0,310.0,False,"Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators;Know My Name: A Memoir;The Witches Are Coming;Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion;Dear Girls: Intimate Tales, Untold Secrets, & Advice for Living Your Best Life;The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation;Red at the Bone;The Dutch House;Three Women;Fleishman Is in Trouble;The Education of an Idealist: A Memoir;The Only Plane in the Sky: An Oral History of September 11, 2001;Such a Fun Age;In the Dream House;The Testaments (The Handmaid's Tale, #2);Nothing to See Here;Over the Top: A Raw Journey to Self-Love;Inside Out",non-fiction nonfiction feminism politics audiobooks audiobook true-crime read-in-2019 journalism audio,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1573830483l/44767249._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1573830483l/44767249._SX98_.jpg

Betrayal.,0399590412,Evan Ratliff,2019.0,Random House,eng,"<b>The incredible true story of the decade-long quest to bring down Paul Le Roux—the creator of a frighteningly powerful Internet-enabled cartel who merged the ruthlessness of a drug lord with the technological savvy of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur</b><br /><br />It all started as an online prescription drug network, supplying hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of painkillers to American customers. It would not stop there. Before long, the business had turned into a sprawling multinational conglomerate engaged in almost every conceivable aspect of criminal mayhem. Yachts carrying $100 million in cocaine. Safe houses in Hong Kong filled with gold bars. Shipments of methamphetamine from North Korea. Weapons deals with Iran. Mercenary armies in Somalia. Teams of hitmen in the Philippines. Encryption programs so advanced that the government could not break them.<br /><br />The man behind it all, pulling the strings from a laptop in Manila, was Paul Calder Le Roux—a reclusive programmer turned criminal genius who could only exist in the networked world of the twenty-first century, and the kind of self-made crime boss that American law enforcement had never imagined.<br /><br />For half a decade, DEA agents played a global game of cat-and-mouse with Le Roux as he left terror and chaos in his wake. Each time they came close, he would slip away. It would take relentless investigative work, and a shocking betrayal from within his organization, to catch him. And when he was finally caught, the story turned again, as Le Roux struck a deal to bring down his own organization and the people he had once employed.<br /><br />Award-winning investigative journalist Evan Ratliff spent four years piecing together this intricate puzzle, chasing LeRoux's empire and his shadowy henchmen around the world, conducting hundreds of interviews and uncovering thousands of documents. The result is a riveting, unprecedented account of a crime boss built by and for the digital age.<br /><br /><b>Advance praise for <em>The Mastermind</em></b><br /><br />“As directors, we spend countless hours imagining heightened plots and memorable characters that will leave a lasting impression on audiences. The true tale of obsession, genius, intrigue, and vengeance detailed in <em>The Mastermind</em> is as gripping and cinematic as anything we could endeavor to conjure up.”—<b>Joe and Anthony Russo, directors of <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War,</em> and <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em></b><br /><br />“With his relentless and fearless reporting, Evan Ratliff has pried open a hidden world filled with high-tech gangsters and drug kingpins and double-crossers and stone-cold hitmen. The story is as fascinating as it is terrifying, and it is one that will hold you in its grip.”—<b>David Grann, author of <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em></b><br /><br />“If truth is stranger than fiction, then <em>The Mastermind</em> is the truest book you’ll read this year. The only thing predictable about it is how quickly you’ll turn the pages.”—<b>Noah Hawley, author of <em>Before the Fall</em> and creator of the TV series <em>Fargo</em></b><br /> <br />“This is a mesmerizing, absolutely bonkers story about a man as brilliant as he is villainous. You’ll find yourself sucked in, freaked out, and ultimately blown away by Ratliff's storytelling and tireless reporting. <em>The Mastermind</em> is a masterpiece.”—<b>Nick Thompson, editor-in-chief, <em>Wired</em></b>",290,2394,2019.0,480.0,False,"Bitcoin Billionaires: A True Story of Genius, Betrayal, and Redemption;The Players Ball: A Genius, a Con Man, and the Secret History of the Internet's Rise;Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber;Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland;Midnight in Chernobyl: The Untold Story of the World's Greatest Nuclear Disaster;Norco '80: The True Story of the Most Spectacular Bank Robbery in American History;Billion Dollar Whale: The Man Who Fooled Wall Street, Hollywood, and the World;Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World;American Predator: The Hunt for the Most Meticulous Serial Killer of the 21st Century;Kochland: The Secret History of Koch Industries and Corporate Power in America;Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators;Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee;American Kingpin: The Epic Hunt for the Criminal Mastermind Behind the Silk Road;Sandworm: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin's Most Dangerous Hackers;Hunting LeRoux: The Inside Story of the DEA Takedown of a Criminal Genius and His Empire;Breaking and Entering: The Extraordinary Story of a Hacker Called ""Alien"";Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup;The Last Stone",non-fiction true-crime nonfiction crime biography history audiobooks audiobook drugs library,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1540398094l/41181600._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1540398094l/41181600._SX98_.jpg

There is no middle ground."" --Cersei Lannister<br /><br />One of the great joys of <i>Game of Thrones</i> is strategizing what bold moves you'd make in this bloody, volatile world--from the comfort of your living room. And one of the great terrors of being a leader is knowing your real world can be just as brutal--and offices bring no comfort.<br /><br />Every day you're presented with opportunities and challenges, and must decide which roads to follow, which risks to confront, when to deny an opportunity and when to pursue the call to adventure. And you won't know whether you'll profit or fail while you're in the thick of it. In <i>Win or Die: </i> <i>Leadership Secrets from Game of Thrones</i>, Bruce Craven brilliantly analyzes the journeys of the best and worst leaders in Westeros, so that leaders can create their own narratives of success.<br /><br />Craven considers beloved characters such as Ned Stark, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and Tyrion Lannister as they make terrible decisions and fatal mistakes, but also achieve incredible victories and surprising successes, learning and growing along their (often bloody) ways.

With a robust absence of self-pity, she has defined the humiliating onset of ""invisibility"" that coincides with the onrushing pressures of parents, teenage kids, and a marriage gone flat, all while attempting to reinstate her perilous professional worth. It’s full of such quotable casual profundity on the female condition I couldn't read it without a pencil to underline the abundance of great lines. Get ready for Kate!” —Tina Brown<br /><br />Allison Pearson's brilliant debut novel, I Don't Know How She Does It, was a New York Times bestseller with four million copies sold around the world. Called ""the definitive social comedy of working motherhood"" (The Washington Post) and ""a hysterical look―in both the laughing and crying senses of the world―at the life of Supermom"" (The New York Times), I Don't Know How She Does It introduced Kate Reddy, a woman as sharp as she was funny. As Oprah Winfrey put it, Kate's story became ""the national anthem for working mothers.""<br /><br />Seven years later, Kate Reddy is facing her 50th birthday. Her children have turned into impossible teenagers; her mother and in-laws are in precarious health; and her husband is having a midlife crisis that leaves her desperate to restart her career after years away from the workplace. Once again, Kate is scrambling to keep all the balls in the air in a juggling act that an early review from the U.K. Express hailed as ""sparkling, funny, and poignant...a triumphant return for Pearson.""<br /><br />Will Kate reclaim her rightful place at the very hedge fund she founded, or will she strangle in her new “shaping” underwear? Will she rekindle an old flame, or will her house burn to the ground when a rowdy mob shows up for her daughter’s surprise (to her parents) Christmas party? Surely it will all work out in the end.

Puchner introduces us to numerous visionaries as he explores sixteen foundational texts selected from more than four thousand years of world literature and reveals how writing has inspired the rise and fall of empires and nations, the spark of philosophical and political ideas, and the birth of religious beliefs. Indeed, literature has touched the lives of generations and changed the course of history.<br /><br />At the heart of this book are works, some long-lost and rediscovered, that have shaped civilization: the first written masterpiece, the Epic of Gilgamesh; Ezra’s Hebrew Bible, created as scripture; the teachings of Buddha, Confucius, Socrates, and Jesus; and the first great novel in world literature, The Tale of Genji, written by a Japanese woman known as Murasaki. Visiting Baghdad, Puchner tells of Scheherazade and the stories of One Thousand and One Nights, and in the Americas we watch the astonishing survival of the Maya epic Popol Vuh. Cervantes, who invented the modern novel, battles pirates both real (when he is taken prisoner) and literary (when a fake sequel to Don Quixote is published). We learn of Benjamin Franklin’s pioneering work as a media entrepreneur, watch Goethe discover world literature in Sicily, and follow the rise in influence of The Communist Manifesto. We visit Troy, Pergamum, and China, and we speak with Nobel laureates Derek Walcott in the Caribbean and Orhan Pamuk in Istanbul, as well as the wordsmiths of the oral epic Sunjata in West Africa.<br /><br />Throughout The Written World, Puchner’s delightful narrative also chronicles the inventions—writing technologies, the printing press, the book itself—that have shaped religion, politics, commerce, people, and history.

It turns out that many of our instincts―from relying on facts and figures to shape opinions, to insisting others are wrong or attempting to exert control―are ineffective, because they are incompatible with how people’s minds operate.

In today’s economy, we have far too much dismay along with our amazement, and technology bears some of the blame. In this combination of memoir, business strategy guide, and call to action, Tim O'Reilly, Silicon Valley’s leading intellectual and the founder of O’Reilly Media, explores the upside and the potential downsides of today's WTF? technologies. <br /><br />What is the future when an increasing number of jobs can be performed by intelligent machines instead of people, or done only by people in partnership with those machines? What happens to our consumer based societies—to workers and to the companies that depend on their purchasing power? Is income inequality and unemployment an inevitable consequence of technological advancement, or are there paths to a better future? What will happen to business when technology-enabled networks and marketplaces are better at deploying talent than traditional companies? How should companies organize themselves to take advantage of these new tools? What’s the future of education when on-demand learning outperforms traditional institutions? How can individuals continue to adapt and retrain? Will the fundamental social safety nets of the developed world survive the transition, and if not, what will replace them? <br /><br />O'Reilly is ""the man who can really can make a whole industry happen,"" according to Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Alphabet (Google.) His genius over the past four decades has been to identify and to help shape our response to emerging technologies with world shaking potential—the World Wide Web, Open Source Software, Web 2.0, Open Government data, the Maker Movement, Big Data, and now AI. O’Reilly shares the techniques he's used at O’Reilly Media  to make sense of and predict past innovation waves and applies those same techniques to provide a framework for thinking about how today’s world-spanning platforms and networks, on-demand services, and artificial intelligence are changing the nature of business, education, government, financial markets, and the economy as a whole. He provides tools for understanding how all the parts of modern digital businesses work together to create marketplace advantage and customer value, and why ultimately, they cannot succeed unless their ecosystem succeeds along with them.<br /><br />The core of the book's call to action is an exhortation to businesses to DO MORE with technology rather than just using it to cut costs and enrich their shareholders. Robots are going to take our jobs, they say. O'Reilly replies, “Only if that’s what we ask them to do! Technology is the solution to human problems, and we won’t run out of work till we run out of problems."" Entrepreneurs need to set their sights on how they can use big data, sensors, and AI to create amazing human experiences and the economy of the future, making us all richer in the same way the tools of the first industrial revolution did. Yes, technology can eliminate labor and make things cheaper, but at its best, we use it to do things that were previously unimaginable! What is our poverty of imagination? What are the entrepreneurial leaps that will allow us to use the technology of today to build a better future, not just a more efficient one? <strong>

Most of us can easily recall the adolescent social cliques, the high school pecking order, and which of our peers stood out as the most or the least popular teens we knew. Even as adults we all still remember exactly where we stood in the high school social hierarchy, and the powerful emotions associated with our status persist decades later. This may be for good reason.<br /><br />Popular examines why popularity plays such a key role in our development and, ultimately, how it still influences our happiness and success today. In many ways—some even beyond our conscious awareness—those old dynamics of our youth continue to play out in every business meeting, every social gathering, in our personal relationships, and even how we raise our children. Our popularity even affects our DNA, our health, and our mortality in fascinating ways we never previously realized. More than childhood intelligence, family background, or prior psychological issues, research indicates that it’s how popular we were in our early years that predicts how successful and how happy we grow up to be.<br /><br />But it’s not always the conventionally popular people who fare the best, for the simple reason that there is more than one type of popularity—and many of us still long for the wrong one. As children, we strive to be likable, which can offer real benefits not only on the playground but throughout our lives. In adolescence, though, a new form of popularity emerges, and we suddenly begin to care about status, power, influence, and notoriety—research indicates that this type of popularity hurts us more than we realize.<br /><br />Realistically, we can’t ignore our natural human social impulses to be included and well-regarded by others, but we can learn how to manage those impulses in beneficial and gratifying ways. Popular relies on the latest research in psychology and neuroscience to help us make the wisest choices for ourselves and for our children, so we may all pursue more meaningful, satisfying, and rewarding relationships.",122,693,2017.0,288.0,False,"The War for Kindness: Building Empathy in a Fractured World;Conventions of War (Dread Empire's Fall #3);The Sundering (Dread Empire's Fall, #2);The Dictionary of Body Language;Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World;The Tetris Effect: The Game that Hypnotized the World;The Orchid and the Dandelion: Why Some Children Struggle and How All Can Thrive;Awkward: The Science of Why We're Socially Awkward and Why That's Awesome;Organizing for Your Lifestyle: Adaptable Inspirations from Socks to Suitcases;The Praxis (Dread Empire's Fall, #1);How to Fight Anti-Semitism;The Kitchen Counter Cooking School: How a Few Simple Lessons Transformed Nine Culinary Novices into Fearless Home Cooks;YOU: The Owner's Manual 2011;Serve No Master: How to Escape the 9-5, Start up an Online Business, Fire Your Boss and Become a Lifestyle Entrepreneur or Digital Nomad;Has Anyone Seen the President?;A Faded Legacy: Amy Brown Lyman and Mormon Women's Activism, 1872 - 1959;Should I Stay or Should I Go?: Surviving a Relationship with a Narcissist;The Smartest Kids in the World: And How They Got That Way",non-fiction psychology nonfiction self-help audiobooks relationships netgalley science audio parenting,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1490390943l/33155370._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1490390943l/33155370._SX98_.jpg

Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her ""head-for-the-hills bag"". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.<br /><br />Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.<br /><br />Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.<br /><br /><em>Educated</em> is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties.

Their papers showed the ways in which the human mind erred, systematically, when forced to make judgments about uncertain situations. Their work created the field of behavioral economics, revolutionized Big Data studies, advanced evidence-based medicine, led to a new approach to government regulation, and made much of Michael Lewis’s own work possible. Kahneman and Tversky are more responsible than anybody for the powerful trend to mistrust human intuition and defer to algorithms.<br /><br />The Undoing Project is about the fascinating collaboration between two men who have the dimensions of great literary figures.

Using the same combination of rigorous scientific research and accessibility that made his <i>Influence</i> an iconic bestseller, Robert Cialdini explains how to capitalize on the essential window of time before you deliver an important message. This “privileged moment for change” prepares people to be receptive to a message before they experience it. Optimal persuasion is achieved only through optimal <i>pre</i>-suasion. In other words, to change “minds” a pre-suader must also change “states of mind.”<br /><br />His first solo work in over thirty years, Cialdini’s <i>Pre-Suasion</i> draws on his extensive experience as the most cited social psychologist of our time and explains the techniques a person should implement to become a master persuader. Altering a listener’s attitudes, beliefs, or experiences isn’t necessary, says Cialdini—all that’s required is for a communicator to redirect the audience’s focus of attention before a relevant action.<br /><br />From studies on advertising imagery to treating opiate addiction, from the annual letters of Berkshire Hathaway to the annals of history, Cialdini draws on an array of studies and narratives to outline the specific techniques you can use on online marketing campaigns and even effective wartime propaganda.

""F**k positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.<br /><br />Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.<br /><br />There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.",26930,397545,2016.0,224.0,False,"Night of the Rat;Love Lies: A True Story of Marriage and Murder in the Suburbs;Red Russia;Assuming Names: A Con Artist's Masquerade;How to Win Friends and Influence People;Forgotten Bones (Dead Remaining #1);De Amerikaanse prinses;White Rose, Black Forest;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change;The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business;The Ragged Edge of Night;Maybe You Should Talk to Someone: A Therapist, Her Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed;Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future;The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference;What the Wind Knows;The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses;Rich Dad, Poor Dad;The 4-Hour Workweek",non-fiction self-help nonfiction favorites psychology audiobook audiobooks self-improvement personal-development philosophy,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1465761302l/28257707._SX50_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1465761302l/28257707._SX98_.jpg

He skillfully interweaves the great works-by Dostoevsky, Stravinsky, and Chagall-with folk embroidery, peasant songs, religious icons, and all the customs of daily life, from food and drink to bathing habits to beliefs about the spirit world.

Franzen brings an old-time America of freight trains and civic duty, of Cub Scouts and Christmas cookies and sexual inhibitions, into brilliant collision with the modern absurdities of brain science, home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental healthcare, and the anti-gravity New Economy. With <i>The Corrections</i>, Franzen emerges as one of our premier interpreters of American society and the American soul.<br /><br />Enid Lambert is terribly, terribly anxious. Although she would never admit it to her neighbors or her three grown children, her husband, Alfred, is losing his grip on reality. Maybe it's the medication that Alfred takes for his Parkinson's disease, or maybe it's his negative attitude, but he spends his days brooding in the basement and committing shadowy, unspeakable acts. More and more often, he doesn't seem to understand a word Enid says.<br /><br />Trouble is also brewing in the lives of Enid's children. Her older son, Gary, a banker in Philadelphia, has turned cruel and materialistic and is trying to force his parents out of their old house and into a tiny apartment. The middle child, Chip, has suddenly and for no good reason quit his exciting job as a professor at D------ College and moved to New York City, where he seems to be pursuing a ""transgressive"" lifestyle and writing some sort of screenplay. Meanwhile the baby of the family, Denise, has escaped her disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man--or so Gary hints.<br /><br />Enid, who loves to have fun, can still look forward to a final family Christmas and to the ten-day Nordic Pleasurelines Luxury Fall Color Cruise that she and Alfred are about to embark on. But even these few remaining joys are threatened by her husband's growing confusion and unsteadiness. As Alfred enters his final decline, the Lamberts must face the failures, secrets, and long-buried hurts that haunt them as a family if they are to make the corrections that each desperately needs.<br /></div>",9075,150114,2001.0,653.0,False,"White Noise;Infinite Jest;American Pastoral (The American Trilogy, #1);White Teeth;Middlesex;Underworld;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay;The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao;The Broom of the System;Atonement;A Visit from the Goon Squad;Everything Is Illuminated;Consider the Lobster and Other Essays;The Marriage Plot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius;The Crying of Lot 49;Gravity's Rainbow;The Secret History",fiction favorites owned contemporary books-i-own novels book-club contemporary-fiction literary-fiction literature,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355011305l/3805._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355011305l/3805._SX98_.jpg

Her husband and two young sons encouraged her to pursue the job; she had a tremendously supportive boss, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; and she had been moving up on a high-profile career track since law school. But then life intervened. Parenting needs caused her to make a decision to leave the State Department and return to an academic career that gave her more time for her family.<br /><br />The reactions to her choice to leave Washington because of her kids led her to question the feminist narrative she grew up with. Her subsequent article for <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>Why Women Still Can’t Have It All,</i> created a firestorm, sparked intense national debate, and became one of the most-read pieces in the magazine’s history.<br /><br />Since that time, Anne-Marie Slaughter has pushed forward even further and broken free of her long-standing assumptions about work, life, and family. In the twenty-first century, the feminist movement has stalled, and though many solutions have been proposed for how women can continue to break the glass ceiling or rise above the “motherhood penalty,” so far no solution has been able to unite all women.<br /><br />Now, in her refreshing and forthright voice, Anne-Marie Slaughter returns with her vision of what true equality between men and women really means and how we can get there. Slaughter takes a hard look at our reflexive beliefs—the “half-truths” we tell ourselves that are holding women back. Then she reveals the missing piece of the puzzle, a new focus that can reunite the women’s movement and provide a common banner under which both men and women can advance and thrive.<br /><br />With moving personal stories, individual action plans, and a broad outline for change, Anne-Marie Slaughter presents a future in which all of us can finally finish the business of equality for women and men, work and family.",364,2708,2015.0,352.0,False,"I Know How She Does It: How Successful Women Make the Most of Their Time;The All-Or-Nothing Marriage: How the Best Marriages Work;Overwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time;Work Clean: The life-changing power of mise-en-place to organize your life, work, and mind;The Confidence Code: The Science and Art of Self-Assurance – What Women Should Know;Hotels of North America;All Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern Parenthood;The 3 Big Questions for a Frantic Family: A Leadership Fable... about Restoring Sanity to the Most Important Organization in Your Life;Drop the Ball: Achieving More by Doing Less;You, Your Child, and School: Navigate Your Way to the Best Education;Home Sweet Maison: The French Art of Making a Home;The 4 Habits of Joy-Filled Marriages: How 15 Minutes a Day Will Help You Stay in Love;Making Space, Clutter Free: The Last Book on Decluttering You'll Ever Need;What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast: A Short Guide to Making Over Your Mornings--and Life;Can't Just Stop: An Investigation of Compulsions;Spinster: Making a Life of One's Own;Humility Is the New Smart: Rethinking Human Excellence in the Smart Machine Age;Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead",non-fiction nonfiction business feminism parenting women favorites career audiobook to-read-nonfiction,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436197848l/25614228._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436197848l/25614228._SX98_.jpg

But the truth is different: literature and art are pathways of feeling, and our encounter with them is social, inscribing us in a larger community.... Through art we discover that we are not alone.”<br /><br />So writes the esteemed Brown University professor Arnold Weinstein in this brilliant, radical exploration of Western literature. In the tradition of Harold Bloom and Jacques Barzun, Weinstein guides us through great works of art, to reveal how literature constitutes nothing less than a feast for the heart. Our encounter with literature and art can be a unique form of human connection, an entry into the storehouse of feeling.<br /><br />Writing about works by Sophocles, Shakespeare, Dickens, Charlotte Brontë, Munch, Proust, O’Neill, Burroughs, DeLillo, Tony Kushner, Toni Morrison, and others, Weinstein explores how writers and artists give us a vision of what human life is really all about. Reading is an affair of the heart as well as of the mind, deepening our sense of the fundamental forces and emotions that govern our lives, including fear, pain, illness, loss, depression, death, and love.<br /><br />Provocative, beautifully written, essential, A Scream Goes Through the House traces the human cry that echoes in literature through the ages, demonstrating how intense feelings are heard and shared. With intellectual insight and emotional acumen, Weinstein reveals how the scream that resounds through the house of literature, history, the body, and the family shows us who we really are and joins us together in a vast and timeless community.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",16,95,2003.0,480.0,False,Adventures in the Screen Trade;A Country Doctor;Achieving Our Country: Leftist Thought in Twentieth-Century America;Treasure Island;மாதொருபாகன் [Madhorubhagan];Poetry as Insurgent Art;The Age of Acquiescence: The Life and Death of American Resistance to Organized Wealth and Power;Characters and Viewpoint (Elements of Fiction Writing);The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay;The Sympathizer;Breaking News: The Remaking of Journalism and Why It Matters Now;The Mastermind: Drugs.

Thaler has spent his career studying the radical notion that the central agents in the economy are humans—predictable, error-prone individuals. <em>Misbehaving</em> is his arresting, frequently hilarious account of the struggle to bring an academic discipline back down to earth—and change the way we think about economics, ourselves, and our world.<br /><br />Traditional economics assumes rational actors. Early in his research, Thaler realized these Spock-like automatons were nothing like real people. Whether buying a clock radio, selling basketball tickets, or applying for a mortgage, we all succumb to biases and make decisions that deviate from the standards of rationality assumed by economists. In other words, we misbehave. More importantly, our misbehavior has serious consequences. Dismissed at first by economists as an amusing sideshow, the study of human miscalculations and their effects on markets now drives efforts to make better decisions in our lives, our businesses, and our governments.<br /><br />Coupling recent discoveries in human psychology with a practical understanding of incentives and market behavior, Thaler enlightens readers about how to make smarter decisions in an increasingly mystifying world. He reveals how behavioral economic analysis opens up new ways to look at everything from household finance to assigning faculty offices in a new building, to TV game shows, the NFL draft, and businesses like Uber.<br /><br />Laced with antic stories of Thaler’s spirited battles with the bastions of traditional economic thinking, <em>Misbehaving</em> is a singular look into profound human foibles.

The Wizarding world has split down the middle, and as the casualties mount, the effects even spill over onto the Muggles. Dumbledore is away from Hogwarts for long periods, and the Order of the Phoenix has suffered grievous losses. And yet, as in all wars, life goes on.<br /><br />Harry, Ron, and Hermione, having passed their O.W.L. level exams, start on their specialist N.E.W.T. courses. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate, losing a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Harry becomes captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, while Draco Malfoy pursues his own dark ends. And classes are as fascinating and confounding as ever, as Harry receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.<br /><br />Most importantly, Dumbledore and Harry work together to uncover the full and complex story of a boy once named Tom Riddle—the boy who became Lord Voldemort. Like Harry, he was the son of one Muggle-born and one Wizarding parent, raised unloved, and a speaker of Parseltongue. But the similarities end there, as the teenaged Riddle became deeply interested in the Dark objects known as Horcruxes: objects in which a wizard can hide part of his soul, if he dares splinter that soul through murder.<br /><br />Harry must use all the tools at his disposal to draw a final secret out of one of Riddle’s teachers, the sly Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Finally Harry and Dumbledore hold the key to the Dark Lord’s weaknesses... until a shocking reversal exposes Dumbledore’s own vulnerabilities, and casts Harry’s—and Hogwarts’s—future in shadow.<br /><br />Source: <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://harrypotter.scholastic.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harrypotter.scholastic.com</a>",35606,2242639,2005.0,652.0,True,"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: Parts One and Two (Harry Potter, #8);Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, #3);Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, #2);New Moon (Twilight, #2);Eclipse (Twilight, #3);Breaking Dawn (Twilight, #4);The Two Towers (The Lord of the Rings, #2);The Return of the King (The Lord of the Rings, #3);The Hobbit, or There and Back Again;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (Hogwarts Library);The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon, #2);The Sea of Monsters (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #2);Insurgent (Divergent, #2);Quidditch Through the Ages (Hogwarts Library);The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1);The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1);The Last Olympian (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #5);The Chronicles of Narnia (Chronicles of Narnia, #1-7)",fantasy favorites young-adult fiction harry-potter books-i-own owned ya series favourites,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361039191l/1._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361039191l/1._SX98_.jpg

Temujin's young life was shaped by a series of brutal acts: the betrayal of his father by a neighboring tribe and the abandonment of his entire family, cruelly left to die on the harsh plain. But Temujin endured--and from that moment on, he was driven by a singular fury: to survive in the face of death, to kill before being killed, and to conquer enemies who could come without warning from beyond the horizon. <br /> Through a series of courageous raids against the Tartars, Temujin's legend grew. And so did the challenges he faced--from the machinations of a Chinese ambassador to the brutal abduction of his young wife, Borte. Blessed with ferocious courage, it was the young warrior's ability to learn, to imagine, and to judge the hearts of others that propelled him to greater and greater power. Until Temujin was chasing a vision: to unite many tribes into one, to make the earth tremble under the hoofbeats of a thousand warhorses, to subject unknown nations and even empires to his will.

Engineering professor Barbara Oakley knows firsthand how it feels to struggle with math. She flunked her way through high school math and science courses, before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation. When she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her options—both to rise in the military and to explore other careers—she returned to school with a newfound determination to re-tool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life.<br /> <br />In <i>A Mind for Numbers</i>, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to effectively learning math and science—secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they’d known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that there’s only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutions—you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn math. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. <i>A Mind for Numbers </i>shows us that we all have what it takes to excel in math, and learning it is not as painful as some might think!",1146,10745,2014.0,322.0,False,"How to Become a Straight-A Student;Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career;Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World;Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning;So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love;Buddha in Blue Jeans: An Extremely Short Simple Zen Guide to Sitting Quietly and Being Buddha;10 Steps to Earning Awesome Grades (While Studying Less);How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students;Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain;The Productivity Project: Accomplishing More by Managing Your Time, Attention, and Energy;Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones;Fluent Forever: How to Learn Any Language Fast and Never Forget It;The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business;Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything;Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise;How We Learn: The Surprising Truth About When, Where, and Why It Happens;Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World;How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading",non-fiction science self-help nonfiction learning psychology education math self-improvement mathematics,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1575009552l/18693655._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1575009552l/18693655._SX98_.jpg

He takes the night train to Lisbon and carries with him a book by Amadeu de Prado, a (fictional) Portuguese doctor and essayist whose writings explore the ideas of loneliness, mortality, death, friendship, love, and loyalty. Gregorius becomes obsessed by what he reads and restlessly struggles to comprehend the life of the author.

His dream is the total eradication of poverty from the world. In 1983, against the advice of banking and government officials, Yunus established Grameen, a bank devoted to providing the poorest of Bangladesh with minuscule loans. Grameen Bank, based on the belief that credit is a basic human right, not the privilege of a fortunate few, now provides over 2.5 billion dollars of micro-loans to more than two million families in rural Bangladesh. Ninety-four percent of Yunus's clients are women, and repayment rates are near 100 percent. Around the world, micro-lending programs inspired by Grameen are blossoming, with more than three hundred programs established in the United States alone. <br /><br /><i>Banker to the Poor</i> is Muhammad Yunus's memoir of how he decided to change his life in order to help the world's poor. In it he traces the intellectual and spiritual journey that led him to fundamentally rethink the economic relationship between rich and poor, and the challenges he and his colleagues faced in founding Grameen. He also provides wise, hopeful guidance for anyone who would like to join him in ""putting homelessness and destitution in a museum so that one day our children will visit it and ask how we could have allowed such a terrible thing to go on for so long."" The definitive history of micro-credit direct from the man that conceived of it, Banker to the Poor is necessary and inspirational reading for anyone interested in economics, public policy, philanthropy, social history, and business. <br /><br /> Muhammad Yunus was born in Bangladesh and earned his Ph.D. in economics in the United States at Vanderbilt University, where he was deeply influenced by the civil rights movement.

Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.<br /><i>Cloud Atlas</i> begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .<br />Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.<br />But the story doesn’t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.<br />As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, <i>Cloud Atlas</i> is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.</p>",18676,202786,2004.0,509.0,False,"Life of Pi;The Road;Oryx and Crake (MaddAddam, #1);The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle;Never Let Me Go;1Q84;Dune (Dune, #1);The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?;The Secret History;The Strange Works of Taro Yoko: From Drakengard to NieR: Automata;Cat's Cradle;Contact;Slaughterhouse-Five;Kafka on the Shore;Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell;Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World;The Three-Body Problem (Remembrance of Earth’s Past #1)",fiction favorites science-fiction sci-fi fantasy historical-fiction owned books-i-own dystopia book-club,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563042852l/49628._SX50_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563042852l/49628._SX98_.jpg

Supernatural magic is what our ancestors used in order to explain the world before they developed the scientific method. The ancient Egyptians explained the night by suggesting the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. The Vikings believed a rainbow was the gods’ bridge to earth. The Japanese used to explain earthquakes by conjuring a gigantic catfish that carried the world on its back—earthquakes occurred each time it flipped its tail. These are magical, extraordinary tales. But there is another kind of magic, and it lies in the exhilaration of discovering the real answers to these questions. It is the magic of reality—science.<br /><br />Packed with clever thought experiments, dazzling illustrations and jaw-dropping facts, The Magic of Reality explains a stunningly wide range of natural phenomena. What is stuff made of? How old is the universe? Why do the continents look like disconnected pieces of a puzzle? What causes tsunamis? Why are there so many kinds of plants and animals? Who was the first man, or woman? This is a page-turning, graphic detective story that not only mines all the sciences for its clues but primes the reader to think like a scientist as well.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins, the world’s most famous evolutionary biologist and one of science education’s most passionate advocates, has spent his career elucidating the wonders of science for adult readers. But now, in a dramatic departure, he has teamed up with acclaimed artist Dave McKean and used his unrivaled explanatory powers to share the magic of science with readers of all ages.

Through the close study of literature--novels, plays, and historical accounts-- followed by rigorous classroom discussion, this innovative course encourages students to confront fundamental moral challenges, to develop skills in moral analysis and judgment, and to come to terms with their own definition of moral leadership. Using this guide's background material and detailed teaching plans, instructors will be well prepared to lead their students in the study of this vital and important subject. Featuring a website to run alongside that links the manual with the textbook and provides a wealth of extra resources, including on-line links to Harvard Business School case studies and teaching notes this manual forms a perfect complement to <em>The Moral Leader</em> core text also by Sandra Sucher.<br /><br /><br />The detailed and hands-on nature of the guide makes it possible for instructors, with or without a specialized background, to replicate the 13-session Harvard Business School course, or to integrate moral leadership into an existing course, or as a module, or as stand-alone sessions. The manual presents flexible class plans, easily adaptable to a wide variety of business and academic topics. It suggests how to adapt the course to other settings, provides supporting materials, and reviews the approach to teaching ""The Moral Leader,"" differentiating it from other literature-based courses. The author, a Harvard Business School professor with a successful record in teaching this course, also brings into the text the kind of real world understanding of effective leadership development that comes from decades of experience as a high level corporate executive.<br /><br /><br /><br />An accompanying student book, focused on class preparation and the context of each work, helps students address questions like: What is the nature of a moral challenge? How do people ""reason morally""? How do leaders - formal and informal - contend with the moral choices they face? How is moral leadership different from leadership of any other kind? Struggling with these questions, both individually and as members of a vibrant learning community, students internalize moral leadership concepts and choices, and develop the skills to pursue it in their careers and personal lives.",0,2,2007.0,320.0,False,None,prof-devt non-fiction academic,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

He has twice been short-listed for the Man Booker Prize. The New York Times Book Review called him simply “a genius.” Now David Mitchell lends fresh credence to The Guardian’s claim that “each of his books seems entirely different from that which preceded it.” The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet is a stunning departure for this brilliant, restless, and wildly ambitious author, a giant leap forward by even his own high standards. A bold and epic novel of a rarely visited point in history, it is a work as exquisitely rendered as it is irresistibly readable.<br /><br />The year is 1799, the place Dejima in Nagasaki Harbor, the “high-walled, fan-shaped artificial island” that is the Japanese Empire’s single port and sole window onto the world, designed to keep the West at bay; the farthest outpost of the war-ravaged Dutch East Indies Company; and a de facto prison for the dozen foreigners permitted to live and work there. To this place of devious merchants, deceitful interpreters, costly courtesans, earthquakes, and typhoons comes Jacob de Zoet, a devout and resourceful young clerk who has five years in the East to earn a fortune of sufficient size to win the hand of his wealthy fiancée back in Holland.<br /><br />But Jacob’s original intentions are eclipsed after a chance encounter with Orito Aibagawa, the disfigured daughter of a samurai doctor and midwife to the city’s powerful magistrate. The borders between propriety, profit, and pleasure blur until Jacob finds his vision clouded, one rash promise made and then fatefully broken. The consequences will extend beyond Jacob’s worst imaginings. As one cynical colleague asks, “Who ain’t a gambler in the glorious Orient, with his very life?”<br /><br />A magnificent mix of luminous writing, prodigious research, and heedless imagination, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet is the most impressive achievement of its eminent author.<br />(jacket flaps)",5736,49331,2010.0,479.0,False,"The Luminaries;The Overstory;Sapiens: Een kleine geschiedenis van de mensheid;Morality Play;Lights Out in Wonderland;The Secret Commonwealth (The Book of Dust, #2);The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay;In the Courts of the Sun (Jed de Landa, #1);Love Becomes a Funeral Pyre: A Biography of the Doors;Cleanness;A Legend of the Future;Zoia's Gold;Killing Commendatore;Fenian's Trace;NOLS Wilderness Medicine;Schimmenrijk;Homesick;Baas in eigen boerka",fiction historical-fiction favorites japan historical owned literary-fiction book-club kindle books-i-own,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320540908l/7141642._SX50_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320540908l/7141642._SX98_.jpg

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.<br /><br />But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.<br /><br />Source: hatrack.com",42030,1060393,1985.0,324.0,True,"Dune (Dune, #1);The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #1);The Hobbit, or There and Back Again;Foundation (Foundation, #1);The Martian;1984;Ready Player One (Ready Player One, #1);A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, #1);Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter, #1);The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1);Fahrenheit 451;The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1);Brave New World;The Giver (The Giver, #1);Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?;2001: A Space Odyssey (Space Odyssey, #1);Eragon (The Inheritance Cycle, #1);Prelude to Foundation",science-fiction favorites sci-fi fiction young-adult fantasy scifi owned ya classics,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408303130l/375802._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408303130l/375802._SY160_.jpg

136,6506732,5,12/24/14,01/19/15,2015,Mon,Hardcover,0,A Truth Universally Acknowledged: 33 Great Writers on Why We Read Jane Austen,1400068053,Susannah Carson,2009.0,Random House (NY),eng,"For so many of us a Jane Austen novel is much more than the epitome of a great read. It is a delight and a solace, a challenge and a reward, and perhaps even an obsession. For two centuries Austen has enthralled readers. Few other authors can claim as many fans or as much devotion. So why are we so fascinated with her novels? What is it about her prose that has made Jane Austen so universally beloved?<br /><br />In essays culled from the last one hundred years of criticism juxtaposed with new pieces by some of today’s most popular novelists and essayists, Jane Austen’s writing is examined and discussed, from her witty dialogue to the arc and sweep of her story lines. Great authors and literary critics of the past offer insights into the timelessness of her moral truths while highlighting the unique confines of the society in which she composed her novels. Virginia Woolf examines Austen’s maturation as an artist and speculates on how her writing would have changed if she’d lived twenty more years, while C. S. Lewis celebrates Austen’s mirthful, ironic take on traditional values.<br /><br />Modern voices celebrate Austen’s amazing legacy with an equal amount of eloquence and enthusiasm. Fay Weldon reads <i>Mansfield Park</i> as an interpretation of Austen’s own struggle to be as “good” as Fanny Price. Anna Quindlen examines the enduring issues of social pressure and gender politics that make <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> as vital today as ever. Alain de Botton praises <i>Mansfield Park</i> for the way it turns Austen’s societal hierarchy on its head. Amy Bloom finds parallels between the world of <i>Persuasion</i> and Austen’s own life. And Amy Heckerling reveals how she transformed the characters of <i>Emma</i> into denizens of 1990s Beverly Hills for her comedy <i>Clueless</i>. From Harold Bloom to Martin Amis, Somerset Maugham to Jay McInerney, Eudora Welty to Margot Livesey, each writer here reflects on Austen’s place in both the literary canon and our cultural imagination.<br /><br />We read, and then reread, our favorite Austen novels to connect with both her world and our own. Because, as <i>A Truth Universally Acknowledged</i> so eloquently demonstrates, the only thing better than reading a Jane Austen novel is finding in our own lives her humor, emotion, and love.",106,843,2009.0,295.0,False,"Tea with Jane Austen;Jane Austen: The World of Her Novels;Jane's Fame: How Jane Austen Conquered the World;Perception;The Jane Austen Handbook: A Sensible Yet Elegant Guide to Her World;The Intrigue at Highbury: Or, Emma's Match (Mr. & Mrs. Darcy Mysteries, #5);Emma & Knightley: Perfect Happiness in Highbury;101 Things You Didn't Know About Jane Austen: The Truth about the World's Most Intriguing Romantic Literary Heroine;Fashion in the Time of Jane Austen;Jane Austen's Guide to Good Manners: Compliments, Charades  Horrible Blunders;Jane Austen's World: The Life and Times of England's Most Popular Author;Bedside, Bathtub & Armchair Companion to Jane Austen;Jane Austen's Letters;Lady Susan;What Kitty Did Next;A Murder Unmentioned (Rowland Sinclair #6);Death Comes as the End;The Pursuit of Love (Radlett & Montdore, #1)",non-fiction jane-austen nonfiction books-about-books essays austen literary-criticism books-i-own literature classics,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320556105l/6506732._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320556105l/6506732._SX98_.jpg

By the age of thirteen, he is banished to a Florida tennis camp that feels like a prison camp. Lonely, scared, a ninth-grade dropout, he rebels in ways that will soon make him a 1980s icon. He dyes his hair, pierces his ears, dresses like a punk rocker. By the time he turns pro at sixteen, his new look promises to change tennis forever, as does his lightning-fast return. <br /><br />And yet, despite his raw talent, he struggles early on. We feel his confusion as he loses to the world’s best, his greater confusion as he starts to win. After stumbling in three Grand Slam finals, Agassi shocks the world, and himself, by capturing the 1992 Wimbledon. Overnight he becomes a fan favorite and a media target.<br /><br />Agassi brings a near-photographic memory to every pivotal match and every relationship. Never before has the inner game of tennis and the outer game of fame been so precisely limned. Alongside vivid portraits of rivals from several generations—Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer—Agassi gives unstinting accounts of his brief time with Barbra Streisand and his doomed marriage to Brooke Shields. He reveals a shattering loss of confidence. And he recounts his spectacular resurrection, a comeback climaxing with his epic run at the 1999 French Open and his march to become the oldest man ever ranked number one.<br /><br />In clear, taut prose, Agassi evokes his loyal brother, his wise coach, his gentle trainer, all the people who help him regain his balance and find love at last with Stefanie Graf. Inspired by her quiet strength, he fights through crippling pain from a deteriorating spine to remain a dangerous opponent in the twenty-first and final year of his career. Entering his last tournament in 2006, he’s hailed for completing a stunning metamorphosis, from nonconformist to elder statesman, from dropout to education advocate. And still he’s not done. At a U.S. Open for the ages, he makes a courageous last stand, then delivers one of the most stirring farewells ever heard in a sporting arena.<br /><br />With its breakneck tempo and raw candor, <i>Open </i>will be read and cherished for years. A treat for ardent fans, it will also captivate readers who know nothing about tennis. Like Agassi’s game, it sets a new standard for grace, style, speed, and power.",5908,70987,2009.0,388.0,False,"Rafa;A Champion's Mind: Lessons from a Life in Tennis;Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of NIKE;Winning Ugly: Mental Warfare in Tennis--Lessons from a Master;You Cannot Be Serious;Breaking Back: How I Lost Everything and Won Back My Life;The Tender Bar: A Memoir;Every Second Counts;Strokes of Genius: Federer, Nadal, and the Greatest Match Ever Played;The Secret Race: Inside the Hidden World of the Tour de France: Doping, Cover-ups, and Winning at All Costs;The Inner Game of Tennis: The Classic Guide to the Mental Side of Peak Performance;Guga, um brasileiro;The Roger Federer Story: Quest for Perfection;Seven Deadly Sins: My Pursuit of Lance Armstrong;Scar Tissue;Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disaster;Long Walk To Freedom (Volume 1: 1918-1962);Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen",biography non-fiction sports favorites memoir biographies autobiography nonfiction sport tennis,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320520930l/6480781._SX50_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320520930l/6480781._SX98_.jpg

Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion.

The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre.

I want to swim in the river. I want to feel the current.</i><br /><br />So writes Mamah Borthwick Cheney in her diary as she struggles to justify her clandestine love affair with Frank Lloyd Wright. Four years earlier, in 1903, Mamah and her husband, Edwin, had commissioned the renowned architect to design a new home for them. During the construction of the house, a powerful attraction developed between Mamah and Frank, and in time the lovers, each married with children, embarked on a course that would shock Chicago society and forever change their lives. <br /><br />In this ambitious debut novel, fact and fiction blend together brilliantly. While scholars have largely relegated Mamah to a footnote in the life of America’s greatest architect, author Nancy Horan gives full weight to their dramatic love story and illuminates Cheney’s profound influence on Wright. <br /><br />Drawing on years of research, Horan weaves little-known facts into a compelling narrative, vividly portraying the conflicts and struggles of a woman forced to choose between the roles of mother, wife, lover, and intellectual.

We know good habits build better lives, but it's easy to get thrown off course--trying to lose weight when we eat poorly and sleep too little; spending when we want to save. What makes some habits easy to stick with while others fail?<br /><br />Filled with self-improvement tips based on proven scientific research, <i>Atomic Habits </i>reveals how altering our small daily habits can transform our lives for the better. This easy-to-understand guide uncovers the hidden forces that shape your behavior--everything from mindset to environment to genetics--and shows you how to take control of them. Organized around the Four Laws of Behavior Change, this book will show you how to apply each one to your life and work.

But<i> No Shortcuts to the Top</i> is as much about the man who would become the first American to achieve that goal as it is about his stunning quest. As Viesturs recounts the stories of his most harrowing climbs, he reveals a man torn between the flat, safe world he and his loved ones share and the majestic and deadly places where only he can go.<br /><br />A preternaturally cautious climber who once turned back 300 feet from the top of Everest but who would not shrink from a peak (Annapurna) known to claim the life of one climber for every two who reached its summit, Viesturs lives by an unyielding motto, “Reaching the summit is optional. Getting down is mandatory.” It is with this philosophy that he vividly describes fatal errors in judgment made by his fellow climbers as well as a few of his own close calls and gallant rescues. And, for the first time, he details his own pivotal and heroic role in the 1996 Everest disaster made famous in Jon Krakauer's <i>Into Thin Air. <br /><br /></i>In addition to the raw excitement of Viesturs’s odyssey, <i>No Shortcuts to the Top </i>is leavened with many funny moments revealing the camaraderie between climbers.

But for Captain Charles Hunter it is a life that can also lead to riches, if he abides by the island′s code. In the name of His Majesty King Charles II of England, gold in Spanish hands is gold for the taking. And law in the New World is made by those who take it into their hands.<br /><br />Word in port is that the Spanish treasure galleon El Trinidad, fresh from New Spain, is stalled in nearby Matanceros harbor awaiting repairs. Heavily fortified, the impregnable Spanish outpost is guarded by the blood-swiller Cazalla, a favorite commander of King Philip IV himself. With the governor′s backing, Hunter assembles a roughneck crew to infiltrate the enemy island and commandeer the galleon, along with its fortune in Spanish gold. The raid is as perilous as the bloody legends of Matanceros suggest, and Hunter will lose more than one man before he finds himself on the island′s shores, where dense jungle and the firepower of Spanish infantry are all that stand between him and the treasure.<br /><br />With the help of his cunning crew, Hunter hijacks El Trinidad and escapes the deadly clutches of Cazalla, leaving plenty of carnage in his wake.

A college student and aspiring writer, she devotes herself to a life of the mind--and to the beautiful and endlessly self-possessed Bobbi, her best friend and comrade-in-arms. Lovers at school, the two young women now perform spoken-word poetry together in Dublin, where a journalist named Melissa spots their potential. Drawn into Melissa's orbit, Frances is reluctantly impressed by the older woman's sophisticated home and tall, handsome husband. Private property, Frances believes, is a cultural evil--and Nick, a bored actor who never quite lived up to his potential, looks like patriarchy made flesh. But however amusing their flirtation seems at first, it gives way to a strange intimacy neither of them expect. As Frances tries to keep her life in check, her relationships increasingly resist her control: with Nick, with her difficult and unhappy father, and finally even with Bobbi. Desperate to reconcile herself to the desires and vulnerabilities of her body, Frances's intellectual certainties begin to yield to something new: a painful and disorienting way of living from moment to moment.<br /><br />Written with gem-like precision and probing intelligence, <i>Conversations With Friends</i> is wonderfully alive to the pleasures and dangers of youth.""",6161,70569,2017.0,304.0,False,"Three Women;Everything I Know About Love;Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion;Fleishman Is in Trouble;My Year of Rest and Relaxation;My Sister, the Serial Killer;On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous;Milkman;Ordinary People;Trust Exercise;The Testaments (The Handmaid's Tale, #2);Queenie;Girl, Woman, Other;The New Me;コンビニ人間 [Konbini ningen];Outline;Daisy Jones & The Six;Expectation",fiction favorites contemporary read-in-2019 literary-fiction read-2019 ireland book-club books-i-own novels,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1500031338l/32187419._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1500031338l/32187419._SX98_.jpg

But that world, says former Wall Street powerhouse-turned entrepreneur Sallie Krawcheck, is changing - and fast. In fact, we are on the brink of what Krawcheck calls the Fourth Wave of feminism, one that will usher in unprecedented opportunities for women in business. <br /> This all is being driven by the fact that the business world is evolving in ways that play to women's strengths. Because in the increasingly complex and connected world of tomorrow - one in which communication and collaboration rule the day - the skills and qualities needed for success are ones that women inherently possess. <i>And</i> <i>by owning and investing in those qualities women have more power than ever. </i> <br /> Here Krawcheck draws on her experiences at the highest levels of business, both as one of the lone women at the top rungs of the biggest boy's club in the world, and as an entrepreneur, to show how women can tap into this growing power to elevate their careers: from getting the raise, to new takes on networking and mentoring, to navigating career breaks and curveballs to avoiding the biggest career mistake that most women don't know they are making. <br /> At the same time, women have the opportunity to play a more significant role than they know in shaping their companies into places they want to work - or leave to start their own: by initiating the -courageous conversations- about true flexibility and diversity in the workplace, forging non-traditional career paths, and more. <br /> Lighting the path to complete the revolution ignited by Gloria Steinem, Krawcheck shows how each one of us can ride the wave of this revolution to own our careers and our futures. <i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",106,726,2017.0,293.0,False,"The Confidence Code: The Science and Art of Self-Assurance – What Women Should Know;I Had a Nice Time And Other Lies...: How to find love  sh*t like that;The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World;Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office: 101 Unconscious Mistakes Women Make That Sabotage Their Careers;Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder;Labor of Love: The Invention of Dating;How Women Rise: Break the 12 Habits Holding You Back from Your Next Raise, Promotion, or Job;The Good Girl's Guide to Getting Lost: A Memoir of Three Continents, Two Friends, and One Unexpected Adventure;A Thousand New Beginnings: Tales of Solo Female Travel Through Southeast Asia;Worth It: Your Life, Your Money, Your Terms;The Firm: The Story of McKinsey and Its Secret Influence on American Business;Your Money or Your Life;Why Didn't They Teach Me This in School?: 99 Personal Money Management Principles to Live by;I Love Female Orgasm: An Extraordinary Orgasm Guide;Advice That Sticks : How to give financial advice that people will follow;The Complete Mediterranean Cookbook: 500 Vibrant, Kitchen-Tested Recipes for Living and Eating Well Every Day;Womenomics: Write Your Own Rules for Success;Meant to Be: Embracing my Plan B and finding a different path to family",non-fiction business nonfiction feminism career leadership business-books work read-in-2017 self-help,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474562607l/30255672._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474562607l/30255672._SX98_.jpg

Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’ indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.<br /> <br />Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.<br /> <br />The eighteen personal essays collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother’s unconventional, unconditional love.<br /><br />Source: penguinrandomhouse.ca",28248,278766,2016.0,285.0,False,"Becoming;Educated;Bossypants;John Adams;Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption;I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban;Where the Crawdads Sing;The Autobiography of Malcolm X;The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks;Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance;Yes Please;Steve Jobs;The Last Black Unicorn;Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know about the People We Don't Know;Maybe You Should Talk to Someone: A Therapist, Her Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed;Dear Girls: Intimate Tales, Untold Secrets, & Advice for Living Your Best Life;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (Maya Angelou's Autobiography, #1);Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup",non-fiction memoir favorites nonfiction biography audiobook audiobooks book-club memoirs audio,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473867911l/29780253._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473867911l/29780253._SX98_.jpg

It unfurls on a sweltering August evening in 1909 as Freud disembarks from the steamship George Washington, accompanied by Carl Jung, his rival and protégé. Across town, in an opulent apartment high above the city, a stunning young woman is found dangling from a chandelier—whipped, mutilated, and strangled. The next day, a second beauty—a rebellious heiress who scorns both high society and her less adventurous parents—barely escapes the killer. Yet Nora Acton, suffering from hysteria, can recall nothing of her attack. Asked to help her, Dr. Stratham Younger, America’s most committed Freudian analyst, calls in his idol, the Master himself, to guide him through the challenges of analyzing this high-spirited young woman whose family past has been as complicated as his own. <br /><br />The Interpretation of Murder leads readers from the salons of Gramercy Park, through secret passages, to Chinatown—even far below the currents of the East River where laborers are building the Manhattan Bridge. As Freud fends off a mysterious conspiracy to destroy him, Younger is drawn into an equally thrilling adventure that takes him deep into the subterfuges of the human mind. <br /><br />Richly satisfying, elegantly crafted, The Interpretation of Murder marks the debut of a brilliant, spectacularly entertaining new storyteller. <br /><br /><br />In 2007 The Interpretation of Murder won the prestigious Best Read of the Year award from Richard and Judy's Bookclub in the UK (comparable to Oprah Winfrey in the USA).",1259,12231,2006.0,533.0,True,"The Savage Garden;The Righteous Men;The American Boy;MUC - Das Geheimnis von Utilitas (München 2120, #3);Truth to Power: 7 Ways to Call Time on B.S.;Woesten;The Bride of Lammermoor (Tales of My Landlord #3 part 1);Aleph;Escape;Sean Brummel: Einen Scheiß muss ich;Found Wanting;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Other Plays;Čefurji raus!;Not the End of the World;Ana;Play to the End;Otomatik Portakal;The Frighteners",fiction historical-fiction mystery crime owned thriller historical books-i-own psychology default,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

Infrastructure engineers use a software version of this “chaos monkey” to test online services’ robustness—their ability to survive random failure and correct mistakes before they actually occur. Tech entrepreneurs are society’s chaos monkeys, disruptors testing and transforming every aspect of our lives, from transportation (Uber) and lodging (AirBnB) to television (Netflix) and dating (Tinder). One of Silicon Valley’s most audacious chaos monkeys is Antonio García Martínez.<br /><br />After stints on Wall Street and as CEO of his own startup, García Martínez joined Facebook’s nascent advertising team, turning its users’ data into profit for COO Sheryl Sandberg and chairman and CEO Mark “Zuck” Zuckerberg. Forced out in the wake of an internal product war over the future of the company’s monetization strategy, García Martínez eventually landed at rival Twitter. He also fathered two children with a woman he barely knew, committed lewd acts and brewed illegal beer on the Facebook campus (accidentally flooding Zuckerberg's desk), lived on a sailboat, raced sport cars on the 101, and enthusiastically pursued the life of an overpaid Silicon Valley wastrel.<br /><br />Now, this gleeful contrarian unravels the chaotic evolution of social media and online marketing and reveals how it is invading our lives and shaping our future. Weighing in on everything from startups and credit derivatives to Big Brother and data tracking, social media monetization and digital “privacy,” García Martínez shares his scathing observations and outrageous antics, taking us on a humorous, subversive tour of the fascinatingly insular tech industry. <em>Chaos Monkeys</em> lays bare the hijinks, trade secrets, and power plays of the visionaries, grunts, sociopaths, opportunists, accidental tourists, and money cowboys who are revolutionizing our world.

Life is hell for all the slaves, but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood—where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned—Cora kills a young white boy who tries to capture her. Though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.<br /><br />In Whitehead’s ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor—engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar’s first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But the city’s placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. And even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.<br /><br />Like the protagonist of Gulliver’s Travels, Cora encounters different worlds at each stage of her journey—hers is an odyssey through time as well as space. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre–Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman’s ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.",22032,248546,2016.0,306.0,False,"Homegoing;Where'd You Go, Bernadette;There There;The Sympathizer;Educated;Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul;Where the Crawdads Sing;Lincoln in the Bardo;The Testaments (The Handmaid's Tale, #2);Zeitoun;All the Light We Cannot See;A Gentleman in Moscow;Pachinko;An American Marriage;Washington Black;The Great Believers;The Handmaid's Tale (The Handmaid's Tale, #1);Sing, Unburied, Sing",historical-fiction fiction book-club historical favorites history audiobook audiobooks read-in-2017 owned,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1493178362l/30555488._SX50_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1493178362l/30555488._SX98_.jpg

What you need is practical wisdom: the insight, judgment, and strength of character that all great leaders have, but that most business schools and corporate workshops don't teach.

In a style both thought provoking and entertaining, she shows how -history's great writers have always been, and still are, the real leadership gurus.<br /><br />Davis spells out the behaviors that distinguish true leaders from misleaders and covers 20 specific leadership topics, including:<br />Leadership Traps (Shakespeare)<br />Change (Machiavelli)<br />Power (Sophocles)<br />Dilemmas (Madison, Hamilton)<br />Communication (Lincoln, Pericles) <br />Personality Types (Jung)<br />Motivation (Frankl)<br />Judgment (Maupassant, Melville, Austen, Shaw) <br />Character (Churchill, Plutarch, Shelley, Joyce)<br /><br />Each chapter begins with a synopsis of a great work by the author and then draws out the key leadership insights, weaving them together with business examples, the best contemporary research, and tools to help put it all into practice.

In his spectacular novels about the life and legacy of Genghis Khan, he has traced the path of the legendary conqueror from the harsh grasslands of his youth to the pinnacle of an unprecedented empire. Now, even as they struggle for supremacy among themselves, Genghis’s sons and grandsons extend the reach of his vision, taking their armies farther than ever before, into southern China and across the steppes and rugged mountains of Russia to the vulnerable heart of Europe, where they will face the most courageous warriors the West commands. <br /><br />Genghis’s tough and canny heir, Ogedai, is on the verge of being proclaimed the new Khan. But Ogedai has mysteriously delayed his coronation ceremony to complete a fantastic project many deem a folly: the building of Karakorum, a magnificent city amid the wild plains. His puzzling decision emboldens his arrogant brother Chagetai to violently challenge him, while their noble sibling Tolui and his beautiful, wily wife, Sorhatani, will be caught between the two.<br /><br />Chagetai’s attempt at rebellion reveals shocking truths about Ogedai’s health and imperiled future.

Rebellious young Sherry could not gain his inheritance until he married, he leaves his mother's house and on a passionate impulse, he vowed to marry the next woman he saw. But the very first woman he sees is his life-long friend Hero Wantage, a young and charmingly unsophisticated girl. To orphaned, pixie-ish Hero, who has secretly loved him since childhood, it seemed like a star-studded dream when dashing Lord Sheringham asked her to be his bride--for although she knew it was a marriage of convenience (his convenience), it eliminated the depressing prospect of life as a governess. It seems that this marriage might solve all their problems.<br /><br />Back in London, Hero soon discovers the glamorous social scene and strives to make a name for herself among the right circles. But their marriage soon became a frenetic comedy of errors, as Hero tried to keep up with the fashionable and very unfamiliar society in which she now found herself. From chariot races to gambling tables to exclusive drawing rooms, an exasperated Sherry followed in his wife's wake, trying to clear the air after her well-intentioned but scatterbrained escapades. But when Sherry intervenes, fearing she’ll embarrass them both, misunderstandings pile up, friendships are tested and hearts are pushed to breaking point.

Every aircraft is equipped with an almost indestructible black box. When there is an accident, the box is opened, the data is analyzed, and the reason for the accident excavated. This ensures that procedures are adapted so that the same mistake doesn’t happen again. With this method, the industry has created an astonishing safety record.<br /><br />For pilots working in a safety-critical industry, getting it wrong can have deadly consequences. But most of us have a relationship with failure that impedes progress, halts innovation, and damages our lives. We don’t acknowledge it or learn from it —though we often think we do.<br /><br />Moving from anthropology to psychology and from history to complexity theory, Matthew Syed explains why even when we think we have 20/20 hindsight, our vision’s still fuzzy. He offers a radical new idea: that the most important determinant of success in any field, whether sports, business, or life, is an acknowledgment of failure and a willingness to engage with it. This is how we learn, progress and excel. This approach explains everything from biological evolution and the efficiency of markets to the success of the Mercedes F1 team and the mindset of David Beckham.<br /><br />Using a cornucopia of interviews, gripping stories, and sharp-edged science, Syed explores the intimate relationship between failure and success, and shows why we need to transport black box thinking into our own lives.

Drawing on her background in anthropology and primatology, she tried looking at her new world through that lens, and suddenly things fell into place. She understood the other mothers' snobbiness at school drop-off when she compared them to olive baboons. Her obsessional quest for a Hermes Birkin handbag made sense when she realized other females wielded them to establish dominance in their troop. And so she analyzed tribal migration patterns, display rituals, physical adornment, mutilation, mating practices, extra-pair copulation, and more.

Though separated by background, geography, genre, and his marriage, the two authors shared their lives in witty, wry, tender, and at times profoundly romantic letters, each drawing on the other for inspiration, comfort, and strength. They brought their literary talents to bear on a wide range of topics, discussing each others' publications, the process of translating life into fiction, the nature of the writer’s block each encountered, books they were reading, and friends and colleagues they cherished. They also discussed the world around them, the Vietnam War, the Nixon, Carter, and Reagan presidencies, and the environmental threats facing the nation. The letters reveal the impact each had on the other’s work, and they show the personal support Welty provided when Alzheimer’s destroyed Macdonald’s ability to communicate and write.<br /><br />The editors of this collection, who are the definitive biographers of these two literary figures, have provided extensive commentary and an introduction.

With its genius for brutality, the war left few places and fewer people, untouched.<br /><br />What happens to the texture of life in a country that endures such bitter conflict?

Taking us to the ghosts of summers past and to other battles from other times, he draws out the story of Sri Lanka today-an exhausted, disturbed society, still hot from the embers of the war.

It challenges the sacred tenets of the United States Constitution, urban life, the civil rights movement, the father-son relationship, and the holy grail of racial equality―the black Chinese restaurant.<br /><br />Born in the ""agrarian ghetto"" of Dickens―on the southern outskirts of Los Angeles―the narrator of The Sellout resigns himself to the fate of lower-middle-class Californians: ""I'd die in the same bedroom I'd grown up in, looking up at the cracks in the stucco ceiling that've been there since '68 quake."" Raised by a single father, a controversial sociologist, he spent his childhood as the subject in racially charged psychological studies. He is led to believe that his father's pioneering work will result in a memoir that will solve his family's financial woes. But when his father is killed in a police shoot-out, he realizes there never was a memoir. All that's left is the bill for a drive-thru funeral.<br /><br />Fueled by this deceit and the general disrepair of his hometown, the narrator sets out to right another wrong: Dickens has literally been removed from the map to save California from further embarrassment.

Conn Iggulden is just such a writer, bringing to vivid life one of the most fascinating eras in human history. In a true masterpiece of historical fiction, Iggulden takes us on a breathtaking journey through ancient Rome, sweeping us into a realm of tyrants and slaves, of dark intrigues and seething passions. What emerges is both a grand romantic tale of coming-of-age in the Roman Empire and a vibrant portrait of the early years of a man who would become the most powerful ruler on earth: Julius Caesar. <br />On the lush Italian peninsula, a new empire is taking shape. At its heart is the city of Rome, a place of glory and decadence, beauty and bloodshed. Against this vivid backdrop, two boys are growing to manhood, dreaming of battles, fame, and glory in service of the mightiest empire the world has ever known. One is the son of a senator, a boy of privilege and ambition to whom much has been given and from whom much is expected. The other is a bastard child, a boy of strength and cunning, whose love for his adoptive family-and his adoptive brother-will be the most powerful force in his life. <br />As young Gaius and Marcus are trained in the art of combat-under the tutelage of one of Rome's most fearsome gladiators-Rome itself is being rocked by the art of treachery and ambition, caught in a tug-of-war as two rival generals, Marius and Sulla, push the empire toward civil war. For Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier's proving ground. For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will be the battlefield where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the love of an extraordinary slave girl will be an honor each will covet but only one will win. <br />The two friends are forced to walk different paths, and by the time they meet again everything will have changed. Both will have known love, loss, and violence. And the land where they were once innocent will be thrust into the grip of bitter conflict-a conflict that will set Roman against Roman...and put their friendship to the ultimate test. <br />Brilliantly interweaving history and adventure, Conn Iggulden conjures a stunning array of contrasts-from the bloody stench of a battlefield to the opulence of the greatest city in history, from the tenderness of a lover to the treachery of an assassin. Superbly rendered, grippingly told, Emperor, The Gates of Rome is a work of vaulting imagination from a powerful new voice in historical fiction.

And it accomplished this...’ writes Svetlana Alexievich. ‘This was perhaps communism’s only achievement. Seventy plus years in the Marxist-Leninist laboratory gave rise to a new kind of man, the <i>Homo sovieticus</i>.’ This ‘red man’: that’s whom Alexievich has been studying since her first book, published in 1985 – a people and a culture condemned to extinction by the implosion of the<br />Soviet Union. In this magnificent requiem to a civilization in ruins, the author of <i>Voices from Chernobyl</i> reinvents a singular, polyphonic literary form, bringing together the voices of dozens of witnesses to the collapse of the USSR in a formidable attempt to chart the disappearance of a culture and to surmise what new kind of man may emerge from the rubble.<br />Alexievich’s method is simple: ‘I don’t ask people about socialism, I ask about love, jealousy, childhood, old age. Music, dances, hairstyles. The myriad sundry details of a vanished way of life. This is the only way to chase the catastrophe into the framework of the mundane and attempt to tell a story. Try to figure things out. It never ceases to amaze me how interesting ordinary, everyday life is. There are an endless number of human truths... History’s sole concern is the facts; emotions are out of its realm of interest. It’s considered improper to admit feelings into history. I look at the world as a writer, not strictly an historian.

D. Salinger. She spends her days in a plush, wood-paneled office, where Dictaphones and typewriters still reign and old-time agents doze at their desks after martini lunches. At night she goes home to the tiny, threadbare Williamsburg apartment she shares with her socialist boyfriend. Precariously balanced between glamour and poverty, surrounded by titanic personalities, and struggling to trust her own artistic instinct, Rakoff is tasked with answering Salinger’s voluminous fan mail. But as she reads the candid, heart-wrenching letters from his readers around the world, she finds herself unable to type out the agency’s decades-old form response. Instead, drawn inexorably into the emotional world of Salinger’s devotees, she abandons the template and begins writing back. Over the course of the year, she finds her own voice by acting as Salinger’s, on her own dangerous and liberating terms. <br /><br /> Rakoff paints a vibrant portrait of a bright, hungry young woman navigating a heady and longed-for world, trying to square romantic aspirations with burgeoning self-awareness, the idea of a life with life itself.

Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance.

And unlike baseball or tennis, soccer is freighted with the weight of ancient hatreds and history.

Far from the triumph of capitalism that the right predicted, it has entrenched corruption. <br /><br />From Brazil to Bosnia, and Italy to Iran, this is an eye-opening chronicle of how a beautiful sport and its fanatical followers can highlight the fault lines of a society, whether it's terrorism, poverty, anti-Semitism, or radical Islam -- issues that now have an impact on all of us.

Now, however, conversation has turned to whether it's necessary to have it all or, perhaps more controversial, whether children are really a requirement for a fulfilling life. The idea that some women and men prefer not to have children is often met with sharp criticism and incredulity by the public and mainstream media.<br /><br />In this provocative and controversial collection of essays, curated by writer Meghan Daum, sixteen acclaimed writers explain why they have chosen to eschew parenthood. Contributors Lionel Shriver, Sigrid Nunez, Kate Christiensen, Elliott Holt, Geoff Dyer, and Tim Kreider, among others, offer a unique perspective on the overwhelming cultural pressure of parenthood.<br /><br /><i>Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed</i> makes a thoughtful and passionate case for why parenthood is not the only path in life, taking our parent-centric, kid-fixated, baby-bump-patrolling culture to task in the process.

Unfolding in a graveyard over the course of a single night, narrated by a dazzling chorus of voices, Lincoln in the Bardo is a literary experience unlike any other—for no one but Saunders could conceive it.<br /><br />February 1862. The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln’s beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. “My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,” the president says at the time. “God has called him home.” Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returned to the crypt several times alone to hold his boy’s body.<br /><br />From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a thrilling, supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory, where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state—called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo—a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie’s soul.<br /><br />Lincoln in the Bardo is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction’s ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices—living and dead, historical and invented—to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end?",18215,108903,2017.0,343.0,False,"Sing, Unburied, Sing;Exit West;Less;There There;The Overstory;The Underground Railroad;Milkman;Pachinko;Manhattan Beach;The Nickel Boys;A Gentleman in Moscow;Washington Black;Circe;Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI;Normal People;The Immortalists;The Sellout;History of Wolves",fiction historical-fiction favorites audiobook book-club audiobooks audio fantasy abandoned literary-fiction,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492130850l/29906980._SX50_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492130850l/29906980._SX98_.jpg

Above all else, Cleopatra was a shrewd strategist and an ingenious negotiator.<br /><br />Though her life spanned fewer than forty years, it reshaped the contours of the ancient world. She was married twice, each time to a brother. She waged a brutal civil war against the first when both were teenagers. She poisoned the second. Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties. Cleopatra appears to have had sex with only two men. They happen, however, to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women. Cleopatra had a child with Caesar and–after his murder–three more with his protégé. Already she was the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean; the relationship with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of the age. The two would together attempt to forge a new empire, in an alliance that spelled their ends. Cleopatra has lodged herself in our imaginations ever since.<br /><br />Famous long before she was notorious, Cleopatra has gone down in history for all the wrong reasons. Shakespeare and Shaw put words in her mouth. Michelangelo, Tiepolo, and Elizabeth Taylor put a face to her name. Along the way, Cleopatra’s supple personality and the drama of her circumstances have been lost.

While most untouchables are illiterate, her family was educated by Canadian missionaries in the 1930s, making it possible for Gidla to attend elite schools and move to America at the age of twenty-six. It was only then that she saw how extraordinary—and yet how typical—her family history truly was. Her mother, Manjula, and uncles Satyam and Carey were born in the last days of British colonial rule. They grew up in a world marked by poverty and injustice, but also full of possibility. In the slums where they lived, everyone had a political side, and rallies, agitations, and arrests were commonplace. The Independence movement promised freedom. Yet for untouchables and other poor and working people, little changed. Satyam, the eldest, switched allegiance to the Communist Party. Gidla recounts his incredible life—how he became a famous poet, student, labor organizer, and founder of a left-wing guerrilla movement. And Gidla charts her mother’s battles with caste and women’s oppression.

But, what happened to the fairest, noblest, and finest profession that de la Vega saw? <br /><br /> De la Vega hit on an essential truth that has been forgotten: finance can be just as principled, life-affirming, and <i>worthy</i> as it can be fraught with questionable practices.  Today, finance is shrouded in mystery for outsiders, while many insiders are uneasy with the disrepute of their profession.  How can finance become more accessible and also recover its nobility?<br /><br /> Harvard Business School professor Mihir Desai, in his “last lecture” to the graduating Harvard MBA class of 2015, took up the cause of restoring humanity to finance. With incisive wit and irony, his lecture drew upon a rich knowledge of literature, film, history, and philosophy to explain the inner workings of finance in a manner that has never been seen before.<br /><br /> This book captures Desai’s lucid exploration of the ideas of finance as seen through the unusual prism of the humanities. Through this novel, creative approach, Desai shows that outsiders can access the underlying ideas easily and insiders can reacquaint themselves with the core humanity of their profession.<br /><br /> The mix of finance and the humanities creates unusual pairings: Jane Austen and Anthony Trollope are guides to risk management; Jeff Koons becomes an advocate of leverage; and Mel Brooks’s <i>The Producers</i> teaches us about fiduciary responsibility. In Desai’s vision, the principles of finance also provide answers to critical questions in our lives. Among many surprising parallels, bankruptcy teaches us how to react to failure, the lessons of mergers apply to marriages, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model demonstrates the true value of relationships.<br /><br /> THE WISDOM OF FINANCE is a wholly unique book, offering a refreshing new perspective on one of the world’s most complex and misunderstood professions.",129,1105,2017.0,223.0,False,"Adaptive Markets: Financial Evolution at the Speed of Thought;Good Economics for Hard Times: Better Answers to Our Biggest Problems;An Economist Walks Into a Brothel: And Other Unexpected Places to Understand Risk;Firefighting: The Financial Crisis and Its Lessons;The Man Who Solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution;What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence;The Alchemy of Finance;Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts;Alchemy: The Surprising Power of Ideas That Don't Make Sense;The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the Global Economy;A Man for All Markets;The Model Thinker: What You Need to Know to Make Data Work for You;The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google;Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries;America's Bank: The Epic Struggle to Create the Federal Reserve;Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future;Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World;Keeping At It: The Quest for Sound Money and Good Government",finance business economics non-fiction nonfiction history favorites philosophy investing finance-investing,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475307109l/30971680._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475307109l/30971680._SX98_.jpg

It is commonplace and it is impossible to imagine. It is prosaic and it is mysterious. It is at once banal, bizarre, compelling, tedious, comic, and catastrophic. To become a mother is to become the chief actor in a drama of human existence to which no one turns up. It is the process by which an ordinary life is transformed unseen into a story of strange and powerful passions, of love and servitude, of confinement and compassion.<br /><br />In a book that is touching, hilarious, provocative, and profoundly insightful, novelist Rachel Cusk attempts to tell something of an old story set in a new era of sexual equality. Cusk's account of a year of modern motherhood becomes many stories: a farewell to freedom, sleep, and time; a lesson in humility and hard work; a journey to the roots of love; a meditation on madness and mortality; and most of all a sentimental education in babies, books, toddler groups, bad advice, crying, breastfeeding, and never being alone.<br /><br /><b>""Funny and smart and refreshingly akin to a war diary--sort of Apocalypse Baby Now...<i>A Life's Work</i> is wholly original and unabashedly true.""--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b>",203,1468,2001.0,224.0,False,"Making Babies: Stumbling into Motherhood;Little Labors;Motherhood;Barndom;And Now We Have Everything: On Motherhood Before I Was Ready;How Should a Person Be?;The Cost of Living: A Working Autobiography;The Undying;The Topeka School;Things I Don't Want to Know;The Man Who Saw Everything;Youth;Exquisite Cadavers;An Excellent Choice: Panic and Joy on My Solo Path to Motherhood;Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion;Cribsheet: A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool;Fleishman Is in Trouble;Operating Instructions: A Journal of My Son's First Year",parenting memoir non-fiction nonfiction motherhood memoirs women biography feminism family,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312001649l/522426._SX50_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312001649l/522426._SX98_.jpg

Due to an exponential increase in computing power, climbers atop Mount Everest enjoy excellent cell-phone service and self-driving cars are taking to the roads. A parallel explosion of economic interdependency has created new riches as well as spiraling debt burdens.

Spanning much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the novel follows the fortunes of the extraordinary Whittaker family as led by the enterprising Henry Whittaker—a poor-born Englishman who makes a great fortune in the South American quinine trade, eventually becoming the richest man in Philadelphia. Born in 1800, Henry's brilliant daughter, Alma (who inherits both her father's money and his mind), ultimately becomes a botanist of considerable gifts herself. As Alma's research takes her deeper into the mysteries of evolution, she falls in love with a man named Ambrose Pike who makes incomparable paintings of orchids and who draws her in the exact opposite direction — into the realm of the spiritual, the divine, and the magical. Alma is a clear-minded scientist; Ambrose a utopian artist — but what unites this unlikely couple is a desperate need to understand the workings of this world and the mechanisms behind all life.<br /><br />Exquisitely researched and told at a galloping pace, The Signature of All Things soars across the globe—from London to Peru to Philadelphia to Tahiti to Amsterdam, and beyond. Along the way, the story is peopled with unforgettable characters: missionaries, abolitionists, adventurers, astronomers, sea captains, geniuses, and the quite mad. But most memorable of all, it is the story of Alma Whittaker, who — born in the Age of Enlightenment, but living well into the Industrial Revolution — bears witness to that extraordinary moment in human history when all the old assumptions about science, religion, commerce, and class were exploding into dangerous new ideas. Written in the bold, questing spirit of that singular time, Gilbert's wise, deep, and spellbinding tale is certain to capture the hearts and minds of readers.",10911,86464,2013.0,501.0,False,"The Dutch House;Unsheltered;Where the Crawdads Sing;The Testaments (The Handmaid's Tale, #2);The Giver of Stars;State of Wonder;Olive, Again;Three Women;Prodigal Summer;The World That We Knew;The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek;Gathering Moss: A Natural and Cultural History of Mosses;Mrs. Everything;Normal People;Becoming;The Secrets We Kept;Educated;Once Upon a River",fiction historical-fiction favorites book-club historical audiobook audiobooks audio books-i-own science,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1560901426l/17465453._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1560901426l/17465453._SX98_.jpg

  <b>A call-to-arms about the broken nature of artificial intelligence, and the powerful corporations that are turning the human-machine relationship on its head.<br /><br /></b>
</b>We like to think that we are in control of the future of ""artificial"" intelligence. The reality, though, is that we--the everyday people whose data powers AI--aren't actually in control of anything. When, for example, we speak with Alexa, we contribute that data to a system we can't see and have no input into--one largely free from regulation or oversight. The big nine corporations--Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba, Microsoft, IBM and Apple--are the new gods of AI and are short-changing our futures to reap immediate financial gain. <br /><br />In this book, Amy Webb reveals the pervasive, invisible ways in which the foundations of AI--the people working on the system, their motivations, the technology itself--is broken. Within our lifetimes, AI will, by design, begin to behave unpredictably, thinking and acting in ways which defy human logic. The big nine corporations may be inadvertently building and enabling vast arrays of intelligent systems that don't share our motivations, desires, or hopes for the future of humanity.<br /><br />Much more than a passionate, human-centered call-to-arms, this book delivers a strategy for changing course, and provides a path for liberating us from algorithmic decision-makers and powerful corporations.",111,614,2019.0,336.0,False,"Possible Minds: 25 Ways of Looking at AI;Coders: The Making of a New Tribe and the Remaking of the World;Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust;The Third Pillar: How Markets and the State Leave the Community Behind;Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe;Time and How to Spend It: The 7 Rules for Richer, Happier Days;The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power;We Are The Nerds: The Birth and Tumultuous Life of Reddit, the Internet's Culture Laboratory;Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries;Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World;AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order;Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control;The Human Swarm: How Our Societies Arise, Thrive, and Fall;Tools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age;That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea;The Science of Intelligent Achievement: How Smart People Focus, Create and Grow Their Way to Success;Talk to Me: How Voice Computing Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Think;The Future Is Asian",technology non-fiction science nonfiction business tech ai artificial-intelligence audiobook economics,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1541337629l/41717507._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1541337629l/41717507._SX98_.jpg

Stigler,2016.0,Harvard University Press,eng,"What gives statistics its unity as a science? Stephen Stigler sets forth the seven foundational ideas of statistics a scientific discipline related to but distinct from mathematics and computer science.<br /><br />Even the most basic idea <i>aggregation</i>, exemplified by averaging is counterintuitive. It allows one to gain information by discarding information, namely, the individuality of the observations. Stigler s second pillar, <i>information measurement, </i>challenges the importance of big data by noting that observations are not all equally important: the amount of information in a data set is often proportional to only the square root of the number of observations, not the absolute number. The third idea is <i>likelihood</i>, the calibration of inferences with the use of probability. <i>Intercomparison</i> is the principle that statistical comparisons do not need to be made with respect to an external standard. The fifth pillar is <i>regression</i>, both a paradox (tall parents on average produce shorter children; tall children on average have shorter parents) and the basis of inference, including Bayesian inference and causal reasoning. The sixth concept captures the importance of <i>experimental design</i> for example, by recognizing the gains to be had from a combinatorial approach with rigorous randomization. The seventh idea is the <i>residual</i> the notion that a complicated phenomenon can be simplified by subtracting the effect of known causes, leaving a residual phenomenon that can be explained more easily.<br /><br /><i>The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom</i> presents an original, unified account of statistical science that will fascinate the interested layperson and engage the professional statistician.<br /><br />""",49,350,2016.0,240.0,False,"Python for Data Analysis;The Mosquito: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator;The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect;The Cult of Statistical Significance: How the Standard Error Costs Us Jobs, Justice, and Lives;How Charts Lie: Getting Smarter about Visual Information;Are Your Lights On?: How to Figure Out What the Problem Really is;Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World;Just Babies: The Origins of Good and Evil;Bayes Theorem: A Visual Introduction For Beginners;Introduction to Graph Theory;Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications;No Shame in My Game: The Working Poor in the Inner City;How to Lie with Maps;Debt for Sale: A Social History of the Credit Trap;My Sheep Have Ears;In the Company of the Poor: Conversations with Dr. Paul Farmer and Fr.

Beaton returns with another baffling case for Hamish Macbeth, the stubborn, red-haired, one-man police department of the Highland village of Lochdubh. <br /><br />Praised for her wonderful characterizations, wry humor, and authentic local color, M. C. Beaton again adds the essential ingredient for an outstanding whodunit - a plot that keeps readers guessing right up to the very end. <br /><br />Hamish Macbeth's unofficial engagement to the stunning Priscilla Halburton-Smythe is reminding the constable of the old adage about answered prayers. His lovely fiancee has replaced his cozy wood stove with a modern electric one and is busy trying to ""make a man of him."" The only man Hamish wants to be is the one who slouches about the village, gossiping, fishing, and deftly solving a crime or two. <br /><br />Deciding that this may be a good time for a little retreat, Hamish ambles over to the nearby backwater of Drim - ostensibly to check out a posh English chap who's causing a most unusual problem. Single, wealthy, and terribly attractive, newcomer Peter Hynd has thrown the middle-aged matrons of Drim into a flutter, and put their men, dour Highlanders whose feelings run deep, on a slow burn. <br /><br />Hamish's instincts tell him this seemingly charming young man likes to stir up trouble, and it's not long before the seething emotions transform the sleepy village into a hotbed of threats, domestic rows, and violent murder. With Hamish's own relationship raising doubts about hearts and flowers, he's more than ready to do what he now must - investigate the darker side of love . . .",276,4329,1994.0,176.0,True,"Hasty Death (Edwardian Murder Mysteries, #2);Snobbery With Violence (Edwardian Murder Mysteries, #1);Our Lady of Pain (Edwardian Murder Mysteries, #4);Sick of Shadows (Edwardian Murder Mysteries, #3);Deirdre and Desire (The Six Sisters, #3);Daphne (The Six Sisters, #4);Evans to Betsy (Constable Evans, #6);A Fatal Chapter (Booktown Mystery, #9);Colonel Sandhurst to the Rescue  (Poor Relation, #5);Sir Philip's Folly  (Poor Relation, #4);Mrs. Budley Falls from Grace (Poor Relation, #3);At the Sign of the Golden Pineapple;Evan Can Wait (Constable Evans, #5);Lady Fortescue Steps Out (Poor Relation, #1);The Taming of Annabelle (The Six Sisters, #2);Minerva (The Six Sisters, #1);Evanly Choirs  (Constable Evans, #3);Evan and Elle  (Constable Evans, #4)",mystery fiction hamish-macbeth cozy-mystery mysteries series scotland m-c-beaton crime audiobook,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

Chip and Dan Heath, the best-selling authors of <i>Made to Stick</i>, are back with a ground-breaking book that addresses one of the greatest challenges of our personal and professional lives — how to change things when change is hard.<br /><br />In their follow-up book to the critically acclaimed international bestseller <i>Made to Stick</i>, Chip and Dan Heath talk about how difficult change is in our companies, our careers, and our lives, why change is so hard, and how we can overcome our resistance and make change happen. The Heaths liken the human mind to two distinct entities — the animal mind, or what psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls the elephant, and the logical brain, which Haidt describes as the rider. The elephant is instinctive; it acts on emotion. It likes gorging on Oreos and sleeping in. And it loves routines — doing things the same old way, every day.<br /><br />The rider is the planner and thinker. The rider obsesses about the future. He or she wants to stop eating junk food and stop hitting the snooze button. But it’s hard, because when the rider and elephant disagree on where to go, the rider usually loses. And that describes the essential tension between our primitive emotional brain and our high intellect, and helps to explain why changing how we behave is so difficult. The secret to making a switch is understanding this odd couple relationship. Direct the Rider. Motivate the Elephant. Shape the Path.<br /><br />Throughout <i>Switch</i>, Chip and Dan Heath illustrate and explain situations in which sweeping change was adopted, from a university researcher who ended the cycle of child abuse in a group of families, to an entrepreneur who turned his skeptical employees into customer service zealots and saved his company. <br /><br />In the tradition of <i>Made to Stick</i>, <i>Blink</i>, and <i>Outliers</i>, <i>Switch</i> is filled with engaging and entertaining stories of how companies and individuals have brought about and sustained significant change. An indispensable guide to making change happen, it is certain to become a classic.",2649,39115,2010.0,305.0,False,"How We Decide;Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us;The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business;Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success;Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter;Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't;Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rule-breakers, and Changemakers;Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action;Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones;Change Anything: The New Science of Personal Success;The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable;Your Brain at Work: Strategies for Overcoming Distraction, Regaining Focus, and Working Smarter All Day Long;How Will You Measure Your Life?;What Makes Your Brain Happy and Why You Should Do the Opposite;Mindset: The New Psychology of Success;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change;Thinking, Fast and Slow;Influencer : The Power to Change Anything",non-fiction business psychology self-help nonfiction leadership self-improvement personal-development work favorites,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422839688l/6570502._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422839688l/6570502._SX98_.jpg

He noticed that though they’d all done well, there didn’t appear to be much correlation between their academic success and career success. What Raj found even more curious was the even smaller correlation between career success and what he calls life success. The greater the career success, the more unhappy, out of shape, harried and distracted his friends were. <br /> <br />If intelligence helps with decision-making, smart people should naturally make better life choices. So why are so many of the smartest, brightest, most successful people profoundly unhappy?  Raj set out to find an answer to this problem, and extensively researched happiness not just of students and business people, but also stay-at-home-parents, lawyers, and artists, among others. <br /> <br /><i>If You’re So Smart, Why Aren’t You Happy? </i>takes readers on a fun and meaningful tour of the best research available on how some of the very determinants of success may also come to deflate happiness. Raghunathan explores the seven most common inclinations that successful people need to overcome, and the seven habits they should adopt instead. Among his surprising findings...<br /> <br />·The correlation between wealth and happiness is much smaller than you'd expect it to be<br />·Generosity is not only a key to happiness, but a determining factor of long term success<br />·Appreciating uncertainty, rather than seeking  full control of outcomes, is necessary for happiness<br /><i> </i><br /><i>If You’re So Smart, Why Aren’t You Happy?</i> will give you a powerful new perspective on your work, personal goals and relationships, whether you’re already successful or just starting out.",86,595,2015.0,352.0,False,"The Algebra of Happiness: Finding the Equation for a Life Well Lived;Payoff: The Hidden Logic That Shapes Our Motivations;The Charge: Activating the 10 Human Drives That Make You Feel Alive;No Self No Problem: Awakening to Our True Nature;Solve for Happy: Engineer Your Path to Joy;Happiness By Design;Lifespan: Why We Age—and Why We Don't Have To;How Not to Diet: The Groundbreaking Science of Healthy, Permanent Weight Loss;The Wisdom of Finance: Discovering Humanity in the World of Risk and Return;Things No One Else Can Teach Us;A Brief History of Everything;Strategic Alliances: Three Ways to Make Them Work (Memo to the Ceo) (Memo to the Ceo) (Memo to the Ceo) (Memo to the Ceo);Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus: How Growth Became the Enemy of Prosperity;Direct Truth: Uncompromising, non-prescriptive Truths to the enduring questions of life;Being In Balance: 9 Principles for Creating Habits to Match Your Desires;Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration;Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society;Liminal Dreaming: Exploring Consciousness at the Edges of Sleep",self-help psychology non-fiction nonfiction happiness self-improvement owned personal-development favorites business,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1455502438l/26026055._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1455502438l/26026055._SX98_.jpg

The distance between the gunman and the target was exceptional. How many snipers can shoot from three-quarters of a mile with total confidence?

Temujin's young life was shaped by a series of brutal acts: the betrayal of his father by a neighboring tribe and the abandonment of his entire family, cruelly left to die on the harsh plain. But Temujin endured--and from that moment on, he was driven by a singular fury: to survive in the face of death, to kill before being killed, and to conquer enemies who could come without warning from beyond the horizon. <br /> Through a series of courageous raids against the Tartars, Temujin's legend grew. And so did the challenges he faced--from the machinations of a Chinese ambassador to the brutal abduction of his young wife, Borte. Blessed with ferocious courage, it was the young warrior's ability to learn, to imagine, and to judge the hearts of others that propelled him to greater and greater power.

As the daughter of starving refugees fleeing violent persecution in Persia, her fateful birth in a roadside tent sparked a miraculous reversal of family fortune, culminating in her father's introduction to the court of Emperor Akbar. She is called Mehrunnisa, the Sun of Women. This is her story.<br /><br />Growing up on the fringes of Emperor Akbar's opulent palace grounds, Mehrunnisa blossoms into a sapphire-eyed child blessed with a precocious intelligence, luminous beauty, and a powerful ambition far surpassing the bounds of her family's station. Mehrunnisa first encounters young Prince Salim on his wedding day. In that instant, even as a royal gala swirls around her in celebration of the future emperor's first marriage, Mehrunnisa foresees the path of her own destiny.

As the national media convicts Harry, Marcus launches his own investigation, following a trail of clues through his mentor’s books, the backwoods and isolated beaches of New Hampshire, and the hidden history of Aurora’s citizens and the man they hold most dear. To save Harry, his writing career, and eventually even himself, Marcus must answer three questions, all of which are mysteriously connected: Who killed Nola Kellergan?
