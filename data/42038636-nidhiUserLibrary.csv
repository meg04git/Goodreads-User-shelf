According to tradition, it was written around 6th century BC by the sage Laozi (or Lao Tzu, Chinese: 老子; pinyin: Lǎozǐ, literally meaning ""Old Master""), a record-keeper at the Zhou dynasty court, by whose name the text is known in China. The text's true authorship and date of composition or compilation are still debated, although the oldest excavated text dates back to the late 4th century BC. The Tao Te Ching, along with the Zhuangzi, is a fundamental text for both philosophical and religious Taoism, and strongly influenced other schools, such as Legalism, Confucianism, and Chinese Buddhism, which when first introduced into China was largely interpreted through the use of Daoist words and concepts. Many Chinese artists, including poets, painters, calligraphers, and even gardeners, have used the Daodejing as a source of inspiration. Its influence has also spread widely outside East Asia, and is among the most translated works in world literature. The Wade–Giles romanization ""Tao Te Ching"" dates back to early English transliterations in the late 19th century; its influence can be seen in words and phrases that have become well established in English.

But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br /><br />After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like a normal kid. But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.<br /><br />Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying than he ever could have imagined.<br /><br />Full of sympathetic characters, wildly imaginative situations, and countless exciting details, the first installment in the series assembles an unforgettable magical world and sets the stage for many high-stakes adventures to come.",101065,6404079,1997.0,309.0,True,"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1);The Hobbit, or There and Back Again;The Hobbit, Part One;Twilight (Twilight, #1);The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1);A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, #1);The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1);The Fault in Our Stars;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Chronicles of Narnia, #1);Divergent (Divergent, #1);Eragon (The Inheritance Cycle, #1);To Kill a Mockingbird (To Kill a Mockingbird, #1);Angels & Demons (Robert Langdon, #1);Charlotte's Web;The Battle of the Labyrinth (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #4);The Great Gatsby;City of Bones (The Mortal Instruments, #1);1984",fantasy favorites young-adult fiction harry-potter books-i-own owned ya favourites series,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474154022l/3._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474154022l/3._SX98_.jpg

It is considered one of the greatest literary works written in modern times in Hindi literature. It also signifies the epitome of Chhayavadi school of Hindi poetry which gained popularity in late nineteenth and early twentieth century.<br /><br />Kamayani depicts the interplay of human emotions, thoughts, and actions by taking mythological metaphors. Kamayani has personalities like Manu, Ida and Shraddha who are found in the Vedas. The great deluge described in the poem has its origin in Satapatha Brahmana. Explaining his metaphorical presentation of Vedic characters, the poet said:<br />""Ida was the sister of the gods, giving consciousness to entire mankind. For this reason there is an Ida Karma in the Yagnas. This erudition of Ida created a rift between Shraddha and Manu. Then with the progressive intelligence searching for unbridled pleasures, the impasse was inevitable. This story is so very ancient that metaphor has wonderfully mingled with history. Therefore, Manu, Shraddha and Ida while maintaining their historical importance may also express the symbolic import. Manu represents the mind with its faculties of the head and heart and these are again symbolized as Faith (Shraddha) and Intelligence (Ida) respectively. On this data is based the story of Kamayani.""<br />The plot is based on the Vedic story where Manu, the man surviving after the deluge (Pralaya), is emotionless (Bhavanasunya). Manu starts getting involved in various emotions, thoughts and actions. These are sequentially portrayed with Shraddha, Ida, Kilaat and other characters playing there part, contributing in them. The chapters are named after these emotions, thoughts or actions. Some people consider that the sequence of chapters denotes the change of personality in a mans life with age.<br />Following is the sequence:<br /><br />Chinta (Anxiety)<br />Asha (Hope)<br />Shraddha (Reverential belief, Faith, Virtue of being a woman)<br />Kama (Sexual love)<br />Vasna (Passion for material pleasure)<br />Lajja (Shyness)<br />Karma (Action)<br />Irshyaa (Jealousy)<br />Ida (Logic, Intellect)<br />Swapna (Dream)<br />Sangharsh (Internal conflict)<br />Nirved (Disregard of worldly things, Renunciation)<br />Darshan (Philosophy, Vision)<br />Rahasya (Hidden knowledge, Mystery)<br />Anand (Bliss, Self-realization, Shiva)",9,400,1899.0,110.0,False,राग दरबारी;Nirmala;रश्मिरथी;आषाढ़ का एक दिन;गोदान [Godaan];गबन;मैला आँचल;Karmabhumi;मधुशाला;कुरुक्षेत्र;सूरज का सातवाँ घोड़ा;उर्वशी;वैशाली की नगरवधू [Vaishali ki Nagarvadhu];रात पश्मीने की;वोल्गा से गंगा;चित्रलेखा;साये में धूप [Saaye mein Dhoop];परीक्षा,hindi poetry classics hindi-lit indian personal-library poem bored-later to-read-fiction india-history,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

An encounter with the mystical Yogi Tarchen inspires a breakthrough discovery about her past—one with dramatic implications for us all. And overheard conversations between ivy-league psychologists, high-ranking lamas, and famous writers who congregate at the Himalaya Book Café help her explore the convergence between science and Buddhism on the vital subject of happiness.     Sparkling with wisdom, warmth, and a touch of mischief, <i>The Dalai Lama’s Cat and the Art of Purring </i>is a charming reminder of why HHC is becoming one of the most-loved cats around the world.So what is the true cause of purring? The Dalai Lama whispers this secret on his return—only for the ears of HHC and those with whom she has a karmic connection . . . that, dear reader, means you!",238,2124,2013.0,110.0,True,"Il treno dei bambini;Labyrint pohybu;The Third Rule Of Ten (A Tenzing Norbu Mystery, #3);The First Rule of Ten (A Tenzing Norbu Mystery, #1);Dinner with Buddha;An Introduction to Buddhism;The Fourth Rule of Ten (A Tenzing Norbu Mystery, #4);A Hora das Bruxas II (Bruxas Mayfair, #1);A Hora das Bruxas I (Bruxas Mayfair, #1);Satyayoddha Kalki: Eye of Brahma (Kalki #2);Mahayoddha Kalki: Sword of Shiva (Book 3);El mejor lugar del mundo es aquí mismo;Truth Be Told: My Journey Through Life and the Law;Rinpoche's Remarkable Ten-Week Weight Loss Clinic;Jurnalul fericirii;Autismus & Chardonnay 2: Pozdní sběr;The Fifth Rule of Ten (A Tenzing Norbu Mystery, #5);Ajută-mă să nu dispar",fiction spirituality animals favorites cats buddhism philosophy spiritual religion kindle,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

  <i>“If you ever doubted that your feline companion has her own inner life, just watch what happens when she falls asleep, and loses conscious control of her physical being . . . a twitching of limbs, a quivering of the jaw, sometimes, perhaps, a snuffling noise or a meow. </i>
</b><br /><b>
  <i>. . . Cats may indeed be capable of great mindfulness, but we are thinking beings too. In my own case, unfortunately, a being who thinks rather too much.”</i>
</b><br /> <br /> In the latest installment of the Dalai Lama’s Cat series, His Holiness’s Cat (“HHC”) is on a mission: to think less, to experience more, to live in the moment. She soon learns the proper phrase for this, being mindful, or, a concept better known to her as <i>the power of meow. </i>What ensues is a journey to discover her own true nature, to gain a deeper understanding of her mind, and to experience life’s greatest joy, the here and now.<br />  <br /> Throughout, there are encounters with familiar inhabitants of Dharamsala, as well as a whole new cast of characters: a senior exec from one of Silicon Valley’s most famous social media companies (hint: the name rhymes with “litter”), the Pope’s beloved dog (who shares a shockingly similar title: HHD, His Holiness’s Dog), and a public health inspector who threatens to have our poor narrator banned from the Himalaya Book Café.<br />  <br /> In this follow-up to the <i>Dalai Lama’s Cat and the Art of Purring, </i>readers escape to the enchanting and exotic world of the Dalai Lama’s monastery in the Himalayas, and take a peek inside the mind of a delightfully imperfect creature on the path to enlightenment. By accompanying HHC on her journey, you will learn new ways to relate to your own mind: slowing down, finding peace, and abiding in the boundless radiance and benevolence that is your own true nature.",130,1339,2014.0,110.0,True,"The First Rule of Ten (A Tenzing Norbu Mystery, #1);Cronicile unui bărbat vol 1;The Third Rule Of Ten (A Tenzing Norbu Mystery, #3);Hotýlek;Dinner with Buddha;Satyayoddha Kalki: Eye of Brahma (Kalki #2);Mahayoddha Kalki: Sword of Shiva (Book 3);An Introduction to Buddhism;Lunch with Buddha;Tiché roky;Trits: Mis, Mirakel, Drif;The Second Rule of Ten (A Tenzing Norbu Mystery, #2);The Body Ecology Diet: Recovering Your Health and Rebuilding Your Immunity;The Garden Awakening: Designs to Nurture Our Land and Ourselves;Breakfast with Buddha;The Muse Asylum;Faith Singer;Destructive Emotions: A Scientific Dialogue with the Dalai Lama",spirituality fiction buddhism cats animals philosophy favorites kindle spiritual religion,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

His eyes were firmly shut and his consciousness withdrawn from his senses when all this was going on. Yet in his dreams he experienced sights, sounds and even visceral sensations much more intensely than when he was awake. <br /> <br />From this he understood that you didn’t need a physical body to see, or smell, or endure any kind of experience with an acuteness that was more real than reality. From an early age he deduced that heaven or hell need not be material places so much as states of mind—and no less glorious or horrifying because of that.
