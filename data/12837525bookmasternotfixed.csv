0,22571882,Young Skins,0802123325,Colin Barrett,2015,"Grove Press, Black Cat",eng,"Making a remarkable entrance onto the Irish and UK literary scene with rave reviews in <i>The Sunday Times</i> and <i>The Guardian</i>, Colin Barrett’s <i>Young Skins</i> is a stunning introduction to a singular voice in contemporary fiction.<br /><br />Enter the small, rural town of Glanbeigh, a place whose fate took a downturn with the Celtic Tiger, a desolate spot where buffoonery and tension simmer and erupt, and booze-sodden boredom fills the corners of every pub and nightclub. Here, and in the towns beyond, the young live hard and wear the scars. Amongst them, there’s jilted Jimmy, whose best friend Tug is the terror of the town and Jimmy’s sole company in his search for the missing Clancy kid; Bat, a lovesick soul with a face like “a bowl of mashed up spuds” even before Nubbin Tansey’s boot kicked it in; and Arm, a young and desperate criminal whose destiny is shaped when he and his partner, Dympna, fail to carry out a job. In each story, a local voice delineates the grittiness of Irish society; unforgettable characters whose psychological complexities and unspoken yearnings are rendered through silence, humor, and violence.<br /><br />With power and originality akin to Wells Tower’s <i>Everything Ravaged, Everything Burned</i> and Claire Vaye Watkins’ <i>Battleborn</i> these six short stories and one explosive novella occupy the ghostly, melancholic spaces between boyhood and old age. Told in Barrett’s vibrant, distinctive prose, <i>Young Skins</i> is an accomplished and irreverent debut from a brilliant new writer.",195,1334,2013,211,Paperback,False,Black Vodka: Ten Stories;Dark Lies the Island;Battleborn;City of Bohane;The World and Other Places: Stories;The Spinning Heart;Show Them a Good Time;Night Boat to Tangier;Solar Bones;Between the Assassinations;Where I'm Calling From: New and Selected Stories;Beatlebone;There are Little Kingdoms;Wild Milk;The Topeka School;The Devil's Larder;Emporium;Short Cuts: Selected Stories,short-stories fiction ireland irish favorites short-story-collections irish-literature library books-i-own read-2015,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1423543900l/22571882._SX50_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1423543900l/22571882._SX98_.jpg

0,16171669,Durbar,9350094444,Tavleen Singh,2012,Hachette,eng,"<b>A revealing account of our political past that holds crucial lessons for today's India</b><br /><br />In the summer of 1975 Tavleen Singh, not yet twenty-five, started working as a junior reporter in the Statesman in New Delhi. Within five weeks, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared the Emergency, suspending fundamental rights and imposing press censorship, and soon reckless policies said to be authored by the prime minister's younger son were unleashed on India's citizens. As the country suffered under the iron fist of an elected icon and her chosen heir, Tavleen observed that a small, influential section of Delhi's society people she knew well remained strangely unaffected by the perilous state of the nation. Before long, members of this circle were entrenched in key positions in the Indian government. <br /><br />In 1984, following Indira Gandhi's assassination, Rajiv Gandhi became prime minister, fortified by a huge mandate from a nation desperate for change. But, belying its hopes, the young leader chose for himself a group of advisors, friends and acolytes from the drawing rooms of Delhi, as inexperienced as him and just as unaware of the ground realities of a complex nation. It was the beginning of a political culture of favouritism and ineptitude that would take hold at the highest levels of government, stunting India's ambitions and frustrating its people well into the next century. <br /><br />Seasoned reporter and distinguished newspaper columnist Tavleen Singh's Durbar is a sharp account of these turbulent years. Describing the Nehruvian era of her childhood, the Emergency of her youth and the political shifts that followed, Tavleen writes of the birth and evolution of insurgencies in Punjab and Kashmir, the blood spilt in assassinations and massacres, of crises internal and external and the clumsy attempts to set things right. A remarkable memoir, vivid with the colour of election campaigns and society dinners, low conspiracies and high corruption, Durbar rewards us with this truth: that if India is to achieve a better future the past can no longer be ignored or forgotten.",209,1798,2012,324,Hardcover,False,"The Accidental Prime Minister (The Making and Unmaking of Manmohan Singh);Our Moon Has Blood Clots: The Exodus of the Kashmiri Pandits;Amritsar: Mrs. Gandhi's Last Battle;Hello, Bastar - The Untold Story of India's Maoist Movement;The Emergency: A Personal History;रश्मिरथी;India’s Most Fearless: True Stories of Modern Military Heroes;Half - Lion: How P.V.

0,33917,The Namesake,0618485228,Jhumpa Lahiri,2004,Mariner Books,eng,"Jhumpa Lahiri's <i>Interpreter of Maladies</i> established this young writer as one the most brilliant of her generation. Her stories are one of the very few debut works -- and only a handful of collections -- to have won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Among the many other awards and honors it received were the New Yorker Debut of the Year award, the PEN/Hemingway Award, and the highest critical praise for its grace, acuity, and compassion in detailing lives transported from India to America.<br /><br />In <i>The Namesake</i>, Lahiri enriches the themes that made her collection an international bestseller: the immigrant experience, the clash of cultures, the conflicts of assimilation, and, most poignantly, the tangled ties between generations. Here again Lahiri displays her deft touch for the perfect detail — the fleeting moment, the turn of phrase — that opens whole worlds of emotion.<br /><br /><i>The Namesake</i> takes the Ganguli family from their tradition-bound life in Calcutta through their fraught transformation into Americans. On the heels of their arranged wedding, Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli settle together in Cambridge, Massachusetts. An engineer by training, Ashoke adapts far less warily than his wife, who resists all things American and pines for her family. When their son is born, the task of naming him betrays the vexed results of bringing old ways to the new world. Named for a Russian writer by his Indian parents in memory of a catastrophe years before, Gogol Ganguli knows only that he suffers the burden of his heritage as well as his odd, antic name. <br /><br />Lahiri brings great empathy to Gogol as he stumbles along the first-generation path, strewn with conflicting loyalties, comic detours, and wrenching love affairs. With penetrating insight, she reveals not only the defining power of the names and expectations bestowed upon us by our parents, but also the means by which we slowly, sometimes painfully, come to define ourselves.",11264,224196,2003,291,Paperback,False,"The Kite Runner;The God of Small Things;Life of Pi;The White Tiger;The Great Gatsby;The Poisonwood Bible;Family Matters;A Thousand Splendid Suns;The Inheritance of Loss;Train to Pakistan;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest;A Fine Balance;The Palace of Illusions;To Kill a Mockingbird (To Kill a Mockingbird, #1);The Hungry Tide;Americanah;Dubliners;The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao",fiction favorites india book-club contemporary books-i-own owned contemporary-fiction literary-fiction novels,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1480106986l/33917._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1480106986l/33917._SX98_.jpg
0,1768603,The White Tiger,1416562591,Aravind Adiga,2008,Free Press,eng,"Introducing a major literary talent, The White Tiger offers a story of coruscating wit, blistering suspense, and questionable morality, told by the most volatile, captivating, and utterly inimitable narrator that this millennium has yet seen. <br /><br />Balram Halwai is a complicated man. Servant. Philosopher. Entrepreneur. Murderer. Over the course of seven nights, by the scattered light of a preposterous chandelier, Balram tells us the terrible and transfixing story of how he came to be a success in life—having nothing but his own wits to help him along. <br /><br />Born in the dark heart of India, Balram gets a break when he is hired as a driver for his village's wealthiest man, two house Pomeranians (Puddles and Cuddles), and the rich man's (very unlucky) son. From behind the wheel of their Honda City car, Balram's new world is a revelation. While his peers flip through the pages of Murder Weekly (""Love -- Rape -- Revenge!""), barter for girls, drink liquor (Thunderbolt), and perpetuate the Great Rooster Coop of Indian society, Balram watches his employers bribe foreign ministers for tax breaks, barter for girls, drink liquor (single-malt whiskey), and play their own role in the Rooster Coop. Balram learns how to siphon gas, deal with corrupt mechanics, and refill and resell Johnnie Walker Black Label bottles (all but one). He also finds a way out of the Coop that no one else inside it can perceive. <br /><br />Balram's eyes penetrate India as few outsiders can: the cockroaches and the call centers; the prostitutes and the worshippers; the ancient and Internet cultures; the water buffalo and, trapped in so many kinds of cages that escape is (almost) impossible, the white tiger. And with a charisma as undeniable as it is unexpected, Balram teaches us that religion doesn't create virtue, and money doesn't solve every problem -- but decency can still be found in a corrupt world, and you can get what you want out of life if you eavesdrop on the right conversations. <br /><br />The White Tiger recalls The Death of Vishnu and Bangkok 8 in ambition, scope, and narrative genius, with a mischief and personality all its own. Amoral, irreverent, deeply endearing, and utterly contemporary, this novel is an international publishing sensation —and a startling, provocative debut.",9650,148359,2008,320,Hardcover,False,"The God of Small Things;Train to Pakistan;The Inheritance of Loss;Five Point Someone: What Not to Do at IIT;The Immortals of Meluha (Shiva Trilogy, #1);2 States: The Story of My Marriage;The 3 Mistakes of My Life;The Secret of the Nagas (Shiva Trilogy #2);The Oath of the Vayuputras (Shiva Trilogy, #3);Malgudi Days;The Namesake;The Palace of Illusions;Shantaram;Midnight's Children;Sea of Poppies (Ibis Trilogy, #1);Revolution 2020: Love, Corruption, Ambition;Life of Pi;One Night at the Call Center",fiction india favorites book-club owned contemporary booker-prize indian books-i-own novels,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png

And it doesn't help that his friends are taller and larger than him, that his parents fight all the time, that his sister no longer has time for him, that the love of his life barely knows that he exists. <br /><br />With an earnest voice that is colourfully candid about middle-class India and the tyranny of family relationships, authority figures and peer pressure, Manan is a tragicomedy of growing pains and the triumphs of a stoic heart.<br /><br />'Parikh demonstrates a deft hand at painting a picture of life in middle-class India in the late ’90s and lends his protagonist a voice that rings true, page after page. Manan is an original look at a young boy’s world, much like the first Adrian Mole books. A keen observer, a compulsive problem-solver and a dreamer with his feet firmly on the ground, Manan Mehta is the boy we all know, the person we all can be.’ – The Indian Express<br /><br />‘An earnest voice runs through this 194-page book, making it a breeze. Read it not for rediscovering childhood, but if you remember that a lot of what you did as a teen revolved around love and sex.’ - Hindustan Times<br /><br />‘Mohit Parikh’s debut novel is an eloquent, sensitive and restrained look at the onset of puberty. Its earnest protagonist stays with you long after the last page is turned.’ – The Sunday Guardian<br /><br />‘Parikh exercises restraint throughout. The language, while descriptive, is never excessive or showy. Fragments such as “Incisors, molars, swallow” pithily describe Manan eating a snack. Students play “answer sheets aeroplane” after class. Not only do you get what Parikh means, better still you see it in the mind’s eye.’ – Mint Lounge",26,85,2014,200,Mass Market Paperback,False,"The Fury / Dark Reunion (The Vampire Diaries, #3-4);Tell Me How You Really Feel;Wilder Girls;The Seven Sisters (The Seven Sisters, #1);Much Ado About Nothing;The Art of Happiness;Twelfth Night;Present Over Perfect: Leaving Behind Frantic for a Simpler, More Soulful Way of Living;How We Fight For Our Lives;How to Talk to Anyone: 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships;Hyperbole and a Half: Unfortunate Situations, Flawed Coping Mechanisms, Mayhem, and Other Things That Happened;Batman: Year One;The Clash of Fundamentalisms: Crusades, Jihads and Modernity;Treasure Island;L'Arabe du futur 3 : Une jeunesse au Moyen-Orient, 1985-1987;L'Arabe du futur 4 : Une jeunesse au Moyen-Orient, 1987-1992;Dans la combi de Thomas Pesquet",india contemporary debut indian-writing young-adult favorites indian-authors indian-writing-english mjhh ya,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407490125l/22885411._SY75_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407490125l/22885411._SX98_.jpg

0,13563459,Asura: Tale Of The Vanquished,938157605X,Anand Neelakantan,2012,lead start publication pvt ltd,eng,"The epic tale of victory and defeat… The story of the Ramayana had been told innumerable times. The enthralling story of Rama, the incarnation of God, who slew Ravana, the evil demon of darkness, is known to every Indian. And in the pages of history, as always, it is the version told by the victors that lives on. The voice of the vanquished remains lost in silence. <br /><br />But what if Ravana and his people had a different story to tell? The story of the Ravanayana has never been told. Asura is the epic tale of the vanquished Asura people, a story that has been cherished by the oppressed castes of India for 3000 years. Until now, no Asura has dared to tell the tale. But perhaps the time has come for the dead and the defeated to speak. <br /><br />“For thousands of years, I have been vilified and my death is celebrated year after year in every corner of India. Why? Was it because I challenged the Gods for the sake of my daughter? Was it because I freed a race from the yoke of caste-based Deva rule? You have heard the victor’s tale, the Ramayana. Now hear the Ravanayana, for I am Ravana, the Asura, and my story is the tale of the vanquished.” <br /><br />“I am a non-entity – invisible, powerless and negligible. No epics will ever be written about me. I have suffered both Ravana and Rama – the hero and the villain or the villain and the hero. When the stories of great men are told, my voice maybe too feeble to be heard. Yet, spare me a moment and hear my story, for I am Bhadra, the Asura, and my life is the tale of the loser.” <br /><br />The ancient Asura empire lay shattered into many warring petty kingdoms reeling under the heel of the Devas. In desperation, the Asuras look up to a young saviour – Ravana. Believing that a better world awaits them under Ravana, common men like Bhadra decide to follow the young leader. With a will of iron and a fiery ambition to succeed, Ravana leads his people from victory to victory and carves out a vast empire from the Devas. But even when Ravana succeeds spectacularly, the poor Asuras find that nothing much has changed from them. It is then that Ravana, by one action, changes the history of the world.",1121,10070,,504,Paperback,False,"The Secret of the Nagas (Shiva Trilogy #2);The Immortals of Meluha (Shiva Trilogy, #1);The Oath of the Vayuputras (Shiva Trilogy, #3);Scion of Ikshvaku (Ram Chandra #1);The Krishna Key;Sita: Warrior of Mithila (Ram Chandra #2);Chanakya's Chant;The Palace of Illusions;Raavan: Enemy of Aryavarta (Ram Chandra #3);Jaya: An Illustrated Retelling of the Mahabharata;Arjuna: Saga of a Pandava Warrior-Prince;Karna's Wife: The Outcast's Queen;Shiva Trilogy (Shiva Trilogy #1-3);Myth = Mithya: A Handbook of Hindu Mythology;The Rozabal Line;Five Point Someone: What Not to Do at IIT;The Pregnant King;The 3 Mistakes of My Life",mythology fiction indian-authors owned favorites indian india fantasy indian-mythology books-i-own,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1332909772l/13563459._SX50_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1332909772l/13563459._SX98_.jpg
